\chapter*{Notes for the Perplexed}

This book is a \textbf{canon of English poetry}, structured such that poems and proverbs are assigned to each day of the calendar.

The calendar used is not the Gregorian calendar, but a \textbf{lunisolar calendar} in which each month is a lunar month and is given the name traditionally assigned to its new moon.

A \textbf{longer poem (\textsongsymbol)}, a \textbf{shorter poem (\textsonnetsymbol)} and a \textbf{proverb (\textproverbsymbol)} are assigned to each day of the year.

See the notes at the back of this book for the rules used in selecting poems and proverbs.
