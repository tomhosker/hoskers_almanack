\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    In winter, when the fields are white,\\*
    I sing this song for your delight.\\!

    In spring, when woods are getting green,\\*
    I'll try and tell you what I mean.\\!

    In summer, when the days are long,\\*
    Perhaps you'll understand the song.\\!

    In autumn, when the leaves are brown,\\*
    Take pen \& ink, and write it down.
