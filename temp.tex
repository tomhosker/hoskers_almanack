\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
There have been times when I well might have passed and the ending have come --\\*
\vin Points in my path when the dark might have stolen on me, artless, unrueing,\\
\vin Ere I had learnt that the world was a welter of futile doing:\\*
Such had been times when I well might have passed, and the ending have come.\\!

Say, on the noon when the \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} sunny hours told that april was nigh,\\*
\vin And I upgathered and cast forth the snow from the crocus border,\\
\vin Fashioned and furbished the soil into a summer-seeming order,\\*
Glowing in gladsome faith that I quickened the year thereby.\\!

Or on that loneliest of eves when afar \& benighted we stood,\\*
\vin She who upheld me and I, in the midmost of \textsc{Egdon} together,\\
\vin Confident I in her watching \& ward through the blackening heather,\\*
Deeming her matchless in might \& with measureless scope endued.\\!

Or on that winter-wild night when, reclined by the chimney-nook quoin,\\*
\vin Slowly a drowse overgat me, the smallest \& feeblest of folk there,\\
\vin Weak from my baptism of pain; when at times \& anon I awoke there --\\*
Heard of a world wheeling on, with no listing or longing to join.\\!

Even then, while unweeting that vision could vex or that knowledge could numb,\\*
\vin That sweets to the mouth in the belly are bitter, \& tart, \& untoward,\\
\vin Then, on some dim-coloured scene should my briefly raised curtain have lowered,\\*
Then might the voice that is law have said, `Cease!' and the ending have come.
