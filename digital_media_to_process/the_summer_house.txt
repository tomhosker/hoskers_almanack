THE SUMMER-HOUSE by EBENEZER ELLIOTT

Go, Mary, to the summer-house,
And sweep the wooden floor,
And light the little fire, and wash
The pretty varnish'd door;
For there the London gentleman,
Who lately lectured here,
Will smoke a pipe with Jonathan,
And taste our home-brew'd beer.

Go, bind the dahlias, that our guest
May praise their fading dyes;
But strip of every wither'd bloom
The flower that won the prize!
And take thy father's knife, and prune
The roses that remain;
And let the fallen hollyhock
Peep through the broken pane.

And spunge his view of Blacklowscar,
Till bright, on moor and town,
The painted sun, and stormy crest,
O'er leagues of cloud look down.
He rose at three, to work till four -
The evenings still are long -
And still for every lingering flower
The redbreast hath a song.

I'll follow in an hour or two;
Be sure I will not fail
To bring his flute and spying-glass.
The pipes and bottled ale;
And that grand music which he made
About the child in bliss;
Our guest shall hear it sung and play'd.
And feel how grand it is!
