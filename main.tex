\chapter{General Introduction}

I'm conscious of how strange this book must seem to anyone other than its author. So, to sum it up in a few words: my intention was fix and preserve the canon of English poetry in the same way that the canon of Ancient Hebrew was fixed and preserved so magisterially by the Old Testament.

The comparison with the Old Testament is both instructive and problematic. For, on the one hand, a kind of English scripture is precisely what I'm trying to achieve; but, on the other, so much of the source-material for this project is itself translation from the Hebrew (and Greek) sacred texts.

Where would such a canon be closed? And how would it be prevented from growing to such a size that the whole project became self-defeating? The full answer to these questions comes in many parts, all of which are to be given in -- no doubt painful -- detail in the following pages. But the short answer is this: two poems, a short one and a long one, are to be given for each day of the year. Thus this book is less of an anthology and more of an \emph{Almanack}.

As always, the reader will be the judge. And the proof of the pudding is in the eating.

\chapter{A History of the English Language and Its Poetry}

This chapter, and, indeed, the entire \textit{Almanack}, is built upon this principle:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{Johnsonian Supremacy}
    \begin{quote}
        Dr Johnson's \textit{Dictionary of the English Language} is authoritative; which is to say, Johnson is always to be treated as being correct, except in those cases where it can be demonstrated that he has made an error of fact.
    \end{quote}
\end{figure}

As a consequence of this first Rule, this chapter shall draw heavily from Johnson's `History of the English Language', which is to be found within the introductory pages of the aforementioned \textit{Dictionary}.

\section{An Early History of the English Language}

\begin{quote}
    Though the \textit{Britains} or \textit{Welsh} were the first possessors of this island, whose names are recorded, and are therefore in civil history always considered as the predecessors of the present inhabitants; yet the deduction of the \textit{English} language, from the earliest times of which we have any knowledge to its present state, requires no mention of them: for we have so few words which can, with any probability, be referred to \textit{British} roots, that we justly regard the \textit{Saxon} and \textit{Welsh} as nations totally distinct. It has been conjectured, that when the \textit{Saxons} seized this country, they suffered the \textit{Britains} to live among them in a state of vassalage, employed in the culture of the ground, and other laborious and ignoble services. But it is scarcely possible, that a nation, however depressed, should have been mixed with another in considerable numbers without some communication of their tongue, and therefore, it may, with great reason, be imagined, that those, who were not sheltered in the mountains, perished by the sword.\footnote{`The History of the English Language'. \textit{A Dictionary of the English Language}.}
\end{quote}

So begins Johnson's essay; and, although his supposition that the ancient Britons were exterminated by the Anglo-Saxons would seem to have been disproved by modern genetics,\footnote{A certain Dr Oppenheimer has penned a number of works arguing that the bulk of the British genome comes from neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the Celts, but from a group of very ancient settlers, many centuries before recorded history. Alas, the Almanacker is not sufficiently knowledgeable to judge their veracity.} nonetheless it remains that, of all the invasions of Great Britain, the Anglo-Saxon conquest has had by far the most profound effect on the language her inhabitants. The language of the Anglo-Saxons provided the canvas onto which all the later developments were painted; thus the same language is appropriately referred to as ``Old English''.

Our knowledge of the Anglo-Saxons prior to their invasion of Great Britain is frustratingly patchy. They seem to have come to our island from what is now known as Friesland, itself divided between the modern nation-states of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. And this hypothesis is supported by the remarkable similarities between modern English and modern Frisian; Frisian \textit{de} corresponds to English \textit{the}, \textit{wyt} to \textit{white}, \textit{ear} to \textit{ear}, etc. We know that, during their stay in Friesland, the Saxons occupied themselves with making seaborne raids on Roman Britain, so much so that the Emperor had to create a ``Comes Litoris Saxonici''.\footnote{That is, Count of the Saxon Shore.} Prior to this, the Saxons are difficult to distinguish from other Germanic tribes, who themselves emerged during the Iron Age from the Proto-Indo-Europeans, whose language is the ultimate source of all European languages.\footnote{Basque and Hungarian are not descended from this Proto-Indo-European language, but these are exceptions to a rule which otherwise holds remarkably well.}

Old English had a similar vocabulary to its present-day counterpart, but its grammar would seem strange to a modern Englishman; the language was highly inflected, with the endings of nouns changing in a similar way to Latin or, indeed, modern German. This tendency towards inflection, though, was shed early on -- it was more or less gone by the time of the Norman conquest -- and it could be conjectured that this shedding was due to speakers of mutually unintelligible languages simplifying their speech in order to be understood:\footnote{And, conversely, the grammatical straightforwardness of English must have been an important factor in its becoming the first global lingua franca.} Dark Age England was a melting pot of Anglo-Saxons, Romans, Britons and Danes.

Not only would Old English \emph{sound} strange to a modern Englishman, in its earliest forms, it would \emph{look} strange too. For the language was originally written in runes, quite unlike the letters of this document, which adorn the many stone crosses the ancient English left to us as an heirloom.\footnote{Alas, there are many fewer crosses left than there might have been; for, in what must constitute the most outrageous example of Protestant hubris in world history, most of these beautiful monuments were deliberately demolished in the seventeenth century.} It was only after the arrival of Augustine at Canterbury in 597 -- the first serious effort by the Roman Church to convert the Anglo-Saxons -- that Christian monks, more used to writing in Latin, attempted to write English using Roman characters. Hence the thousand year nightmare of hammering English spelling into some kind of unity; the language is written using an alphabet which was never intended for that purpose.\footnote{Italian schoolchildren, the Almanacker believes, have a much easier time learning to spell.} The unmitigated fiasco of English spelling aside, Augustine's arrival ushered in another, more encouraging, development: the commingling of the priests with the poets. Henceforth, any attempt to disentangle the history of the English Church from the history of the English language is a fool's errand -- but more on that theme later.

The Battle of Hastings marks an obvious turning point in English history, but, as Dr Johnson points out, its immediate impact on the English language was surprisingly slight; it's only by the 1150s that the surviving texts become noticeably closer to French. In the following centuries, the influence of Old French over Old English grew more and more. There will doubtless always be debate over whether poets such as William Langland,\footnote{The name William Langland is used here to refer to the author of \textit{Piers Ploughman}, whoever he might have been.} John Gower and Geoffrey Chaucer (d. 1400) were the cause or the effect of the last great wave of Frenchification, but what is plain for all to see is that the works of these poets are significantly more Frenchified than the works of their predecessors; thus the language in which they wrote is given its own name, ``Middle English''. Once, to coin a phrase, the graves of these Middle English poets were filled in, the language transformed into a recognisably ``Modern'' form.

\section{An Early History of English Poetry}

Before we proceed any further, it would perhaps be helpful at this point to set out another Rule:\footnote{Here the Almanacker is deeply indebted to the German philologists of the nineteenth century, especially Wilhelm Teuffel's \textit{Geschichte der R\"omischen Literatur}.}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{English-Latin Analogy}
    \begin{quote}
        The history of English poetry is analogous to the history of Latin poetry, inasmuch as both consist of three phases: Early, Classical and Late.
    \end{quote}
\end{figure}

Thus we might construct the following table:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption*{{\sc Table.} The Phases of English: Its Language \& Poetry}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        Language & Poetry \\ \hline \hline
        Old, Middle & Early \\ \hline
        Modern & Classical \\ \hline
        Late Modern & Late
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In the previous section, a history of Old and Middle English was given. In this section, a history of Early English Poetry is provided, and parallels drawn with the history of Latin literature as appropriate.

The Almanacker has already mentioned that the histories of English poetry and English Christianity ought not to be pulled apart; and, indeed, it is commonly accepted\footnote{Since Johnson is silent on this matter, the Almanacker can do no better than follow the judgement of the \textit{Norton Anthology}.} that the earliest English poem is a hymn, composed by an illiterate seventh century farmhand called Caedmon. About a century later,\footnote{Dating \textit{Beowulf} is a tortuous business.} \textit{Beowulf} came into being, along with a handful of short poems: riddles, accounts of battles, `The Seafarer' -- not forgetting an intriguing praise poem for the city of Durham. After this first harvest, very little poetry was produced about which Dr Johnson has anything kind to say until the time of Chaucer.

Now the poets of Chaucer's school were of the opinion -- rightly or wrongly -- that there was something lacking in the literature of their mother tongue, and looked to the continent for a model for improving it. Indeed, Chaucer himself spent a number of years in Italy and France, and his works show a marked and deliberate borrowing from the traditions of those nations. The Almanacker must confess that he himself has little affection for the poetry of the Late Middle Ages, and hence little to say about it; but no man can deny its importance in the history of our literature.

The change which English literature experienced in the fourteenth century after Christ is strikingly similar to the transformation which Latin literature underwent in the second century before; with the treasures of Classical Greek serving as a model for the early Roman poets in the same way that the treasures of Old French and Italian inspired the Chaucerian school. Indeed, Ennius, the father of Latin literature, is reputed to have considered himself a reincarnation of Homer; and, certainly, he made a conscious effort to emulate the Ἰλιάς in composing his \textit{Annales}. A century later, Horace would sum up this metamorphosis in a famous couplet:

\begin{quote}
    \begin{verse}
        \vin Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit, et artes\\*
        intulit agresti Latio...\footnote{That is, `Captive Greece took her captor captive, and brought the arts to rustic Italy...'. Horace, \textit{Epistulae} II.1.156-157.}
    \end{verse}
\end{quote}

Having discussed Early English poetry and drawn the appropriate parallels with Latin, allow the Almanacker now to do the same for the next phase of our literature.

\section{British; or, Good-English}

\subsection{The Golden Age of English Literature}

The poetry of Chaucer and his peers would be somewhat intelligible to the average Englishman at the beginning of the twenty-first century -- but only somewhat -- perhaps just a little more than modern Dutch. Even the poetry of John Skelton (d. 1529) would strike him as essentially foreign. Consider, for instance, these lines:

\begin{quote}
    \begin{verse}
        Though ye suppose all jeperdys ar paste,\\*
        \vin And all is done that ye lokyd for before,\\
        Ware yet, I rede you, of Fortunes dowble cast,\\
        \vin For one fals poynt she is wont to kepe in store,\\
        \vin And vnder the fell oft festered is the sore:\\
        That when ye thynke all daunger for to pas,\\*
        Ware of the lesard lyeth lurkyng in the gras.\footnote{From a poem which begins: `\textit{Cuncta licet cecidisse putas discrimina rerum}...'. \textit{The Poetical Works of John Skelton}, Ed. Rev. Alexander Dryce.}
    \end{verse}
\end{quote}

Some words aren't all that hard to decode -- `ware' presumably translates as \textit{beware} -- but notice the unfamiliar `rede'. And what on earth is a `lesard'?

With Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503 -- 1542), on the other hand, we encounter the first instance of a poetry which is unmistakably \emph{ours}:

\begin{quote}
    \begin{verse}
        They flee from me, that sometime did me seek,\\*
        \vin With naked foot stalking within my chamber:\\
        Once have I seen them gentle, tame, and meek,\\
        \vin That now are wild, and do not once remember,\\
        \vin That sometime they have put themselves in danger\\
        To take bread at my hand; and now they range\\*
        Busily seeking in continual change.\footnote{From `They Flee from Me'. \textit{The Poetical Works of Sir Thomas Wyatt}, Ed. Sir Nicholas Nicolas.}
    \end{verse}
\end{quote}

Now bear in mind that Skelton's and Wyatt's lifetimes actually overlapped by over a quarter-century. How are we to account for such a dramatic change? We might look to a variety of factors, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item{The introduction of the printing press to England by William Caxton;}
\item{The nascent Protestant Reformation;}
\item{The conclusion of both the Hundred Years War and of the Wars of the Roses; and,}
\item{The ongoing growth of national consciousness in Europe generally.}
\end{itemize}

Now all these causes were either brought about or embodied by the so-called Tudor Revolution, which itself began on a specific day: 22nd August 1485, in the wake of the Battle of Bosworth Field. Thus the Almanckist defines the Classical period of English poetry as beginning on this day. And, moreover, the Almanacker affixes to the particular subspecies of Modern English in which this poetry was written a name of his own making: ``Good-English''.\footnote{The Almanacker derives his inspiration here from one of the archaic names of steel: \textit{good-iron}. Note that the stress ought to be on ``Good'' in the same way that the stress of \textit{blackboard} is on ``black''.}

We might also refer to this Good-English literary language as ``British''. For, although said language began as an unambiguously English literary movement, it was to absorb the talents and dialects of Wales, Scotland and Ireland in exactly the same way as those territories were to be incorporated into a United Kingdom via the unions of 1535, 1707 and 1801. Thus the Almanacker regards the terms ``Good-English'' and ``British'' as being equivalent when referring to the literary language, and he shall make every effort to use them interchangeably.

British came into being under the Tudors, but it reached its apogee under the Stuarts. The \textit{First Folio} of Shakespeare, and, crucially, the Authorised Version of the Bible were both published during the reign of King James; and these two books provided a canon around which the rest of the language could be built. Following the Glorious Revolution, English literature entered a noticeable dry spell; the poets of eighteenth century are dwarfed by both their predecessors and their successors. A second explosion of creativity occurred with the birth of Romanticism and the Revolution in France.

\subsection{Latin Analogy, Part I}

Latin literature experienced a Golden Age of its own. Indeed, a century after Latin poetry was fathered by Ennius, it reached its apogee under the care of Ovid, Horace, Propertius and, principally, Virgil.

The version of Latin which Wyatt and Shakespeare must have learned at school was quite deliberately and self-consciously created by the poets of this Golden Age. In just the same way, Shakespeare and Wyatt moulded the version of English which schoolchildren will learn in centuries to come.

\subsection{\textit{Fin de si\`ecle}}

Literary languages are begun by political sea-changes; they are also ended by them. Just as British or Good-English was born at Bosworth Field, it died on the fields of Flanders. Indeed, even as late as September 1914, a good two months into the First World War and subsequent to the bloodletting and stalemate of the Battle of the Frontiers, Laurence Binyon could still write:

\begin{quote}
    \begin{verse}
        Solemn the drums thrill: Death august and royal\\*
        Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres.\\
        There is music in the midst of desolation\\*
        And a glory that shines upon our tears.\footnote{From `For the Fallen'. \textit{The Cause: Poems of the War}.}
    \end{verse}
\end{quote}

But after the 1st July 1916, with its sixty thousand British casualties in one morning, and, sixth months later, the slaughterhouse of Passchendaele, it was no longer possible for a serious and sensitive poet to write in that special language. And in any case, the nation to which the language belonged, the same United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, was to cease to exist in 1922. Subsequent to the Great War, the only options available to an Englishman intent on writing poetry were either nostalgia and anachronism, as per John Betjeman and Philip Larkin, or a wilful embrace of deformity and nonsense, as per Thomas Eliot and Geoffrey Hill. Thus we have our next Rule:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{Bosworth to Passchendaele}
    \begin{quote}
        A poem may only be considered to be written in British or Good-English if, and only if, the poet in question flourished between the Battles of Bosworth Field and Passchendaele (but the converse is not true).
    \end{quote}
\end{figure}

Two important caveats to the Rule just outlined ought to be mentioned at this point. Firstly, there are a handful of poets -- Hardy and Housman being the two that come to mind -- who, having flourished before the War, continued to produce a small quantity of poetry for a few years afterwards. Such poetry ought to be considered as having been written in Good-English. Secondly, there is the literary miracle that is the works of Wystan Auden.

In a sad degenerate age, Auden managed to write poetry which is neither nonsensical nor anachronistic, but which, on the contrary, possesses a compelling clarity and vitality. It could be argued that Auden is surpassed at certain points by Shakespeare. (Personally, the Almanacker feels it's an open question.) But Shakespeare was writing in an age in which poets were turning out masterpieces of world literature almost as a matter of course; Auden was not. Reading, for instance, his epilogue to \textit{The Orators}, it's like someone has managed to knock together a piece of architecture with all the careful beauty of an English cathedral amongst the compulsory ugliness of the Bauhaus. Thus we English ought to consider Auden, and not Shakespeare, as our greatest poet; and thus we have our next Rule:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{Wystan Auden}
    \begin{quote}
        The works of Wystan Auden are exempt from the Bosworth to Passchendaele Rule; they are considered to be written in Good-English.
    \end{quote}
\end{figure}

Does the Almanacker contend that, with the exception of Wystan Auden, there have been no good British poets since the First World War? Yes and no. Of the writers who made the attempt, some were very good, but none were really poets. Consider these lines of Ronald Thomas, typical of the best late twentieth century British literature:

\begin{quote}
    \begin{verse}
        There was Dai Puw. He was no good.\\*
        They put him in the fields to dock swedes,\\
        And took the knife from him, when he came home\\
        At late evening with a grin\\*
        Like the slash of a knife on his face.\\!

        There was Llew Puw, and he was no good.\\*
        Every evening after the ploughing\\
        With the big tractor he would sit in his chair,\\
        And stare into the tangled fire garden,\\*
        Opening his slow lips like a snail.\\!

        There was Huw Puw, too. What shall I say?\\*
        I have heard him whistling in the hedges\\
        On and on, as though winter\\
        Would never again leave those fields,\\*
        And all the trees were deformed.\\!

        And lastly there was the girl;\\*
        Beauty under some spell of the beast.\\
        Her pale face was the lantern\\
        By which they read in life's dark book\\*
        The shrill sentence: God is love.\footnote{`On the Farm'. \cite{norton}.}
    \end{verse}
\end{quote}

Now, what would happen if we were to tamper with these verses slightly?

\begin{quote}
    \begin{verse}
        There was Dai Puw. He was no good. They put him in the fields to dock swedes, and took the knife from him when he came home at late evening with a grin like the slash of a knife on his face.\\!

        There was Llew Puw, and he was no good. Every evening after the ploughing with the big tractor he would sit in his chair, and stare into the tangled fire garden, opening his slow lips like a snail.\\!

        There was Huw Puw, too. What shall I say? I have heard him whistling in the hedges on and on, as though winter would never again leave those fields, and all the trees were deformed.\\!

        And lastly there was the girl; beauty under some spell of the beast. Her pale face was the lantern by which they read in life's dark book -- the shrill sentence -- God is love.
    \end{verse}
\end{quote}

By removing the line-breaks, very little, it could be argued, has been removed from the poem.\footnote{The heavy caesura in the last sentence is, admittedly, conspicuous in its absence in the prose version. But this one detail can be supplied quite happily in prose by modifying the punctuation -- as, indeed, the Almanacker has done.} And, conversely, little remains in the prose version to suggest where line-breaks might have been. Conclusion: what Thomas et al. wrote would be more helpfully categorised, not as poetry -- at least, not poetry of the Good-English variety -- but as elegant fragments of prose.

\subsection{Latin Analogy, Part II}

Victory in the First World War allowed the British Empire to reach its greatest territorial extent; but, subsequent to the same war, it proved impossible for new poets to write in the British literary language. Likewise, although the Roman Empire was at its most robust under the rule of Augustus (27 BC -- 14 AD),\footnote{And in fact the Empire only reached its greatest territorial extent over a century later.} the Golden Age of Latin literature and the first Roman Emperor were buried together.

As in Hesiod's myth,\footnote{Ἔργα καὶ Ἡμέραι (``Works and Days''), lines 109-201.} the Golden Age was followed by the Silver, the outstanding poet of which was Martial. Now a good poem is like a good stout; it builds a person up. Martial's verses, on the other hand, have more in common with watered-down lager; their wit offers a certain short-term mollification, but little real nourishment.

The Silver Age is commonly accepted to have come to an end with the death of Trajan in 117. The literary period which followed is known as Late Latin, and this age produced very little good poetry, except for occasional sparks of interest such as Boethius' \textit{Consolatio} or Jerome's translation of the Bible. It is to be noted that the most important Roman prose writers of this period, e.g. Marcus Aurelius and Cassius Dio, elected to write in Greek.

The Late Latin poets are sometimes referred to as the ``Epigoni'',\footnote{That is, \textit{offspring}.} about whom Auden wrote an amusing poem:

\begin{quote}
    \begin{verse}
        To their credit, a reader will only perceive\\*
        That the language they loved was coming to grief,\\
        Expiring in preposterous mechanical tricks,\\*
        Epanaleptics, rhopalics, anacyclic acrostics...\footnote{From `The Epigoni', \textit{Homage to Clio}.}
    \end{verse}
\end{quote}

Auden no doubt intended said poem as food for thought for the poetry of our own age; but such thoughts are the substance of the next subsection.

\subsection{The Future of English Poetry}

We've already been over how the Golden Age of English Poetry was born, blossomed and died. Naturally, it was followed by a (brief) Silver Age. This period was dominated, this side of the Atlantic, by a celebrated triumvirate -- Philip Larkin, Ted Hughes and Thom Gunn -- and, on the other, by Robert Lowell and John Berryman. Lowell and Berryman died in the seventies, Larkin in the eighties; Ted Hughes died in 1998, with whom the Silver Age comes to a close. Thus the period of English literature in which poetry is currently being written could be referred to as ``Late''.

If the English language continues to trace the same trajectory as Latin, we have every reason to be pessimistic regarding the decades, and indeed the centuries, to come. A handful of interesting poems will be written, a few diverting pieces, but nothing indispensable to the language itself. In the same way, Boethius' \textit{Consolatio} is a well-made book, its poetry not without beauty; but schoolchildren learn Virgil, not Boethius, and a complete understanding of Classical Latin could be put together without that voice.

Thus we can conclude that now, at the close of the Silver Age, is an appropriate time to close the canon of English poetry. And thus we have our next Rule:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{\it Cr\`eme de la cr\`eme}
    \begin{quote}
        Only poetry written in Good-English ought to be considered for the \textit{Almanack}.
    \end{quote}
\end{figure}

\section{The Calendars of Man}

One reads in the first chapter of Genesis:

\begin{quote}
And God said, `Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years...'\footnote{Verse 14.}
\end{quote}

The Scriptures are apt, for the calendars of man have depended almost exclusively on the habits of two heavenly bodies: the sun and the moon. One might say that the history of mankind's calendars is a battle between these two bodies for supremacy.

The general trend of this history is a movement away from the moon and towards the sun. In primitive times, the moon's cycle of twenty-odd days was easily observed, and must have provided a convenient frame of reference for identifying a particular day. The precise day on which a solstice or equinox falls, on the other hand, is much less obvious. However, as convenient as the patterns of the moon might be for an ancient astronomer, their effect on human life is negligible in comparison with the undulations of the sun, particularly at higher latitudes. Thus the vast majority of civilisations begin following a lunar calendar, and then, as scientific knowledge increases, a solar calendar is adopted.

The quintessential example of this process is the Roman calendar. It may well be that the earliest Roman calendars were purely lunar like the Islamic calendar; the Almanckist knows of no compelling evidence either way. In any case, by the time of the late Republic an awkward lunisolar compromise had been reached, wherein a year consisted of the familiar twelve months of our own calendar -- these being defined by the phases of the moon -- with an additional ``intercalary'' month being inserted half way through February at the discretion of the College of Pontiffs in order to keep the calendar year from getting too out of kilter with the sun. Such a tortuous calendar might have been feasible in the life of a city-state, but it proved to be a nightmare for the peoples of an intercontinental empire; it would take many weeks for the decisions of the College to be fully disseminated, leaving the provinces thoroughly confused regarding the correct date.\footnote{Furthermore, the intrinsic flaws of the old calendar were exacerbated by the College's tendency to lengthen or shorten the year according to political, and not astronomical, considerations.}

In 46 BC, Julius Caesar decided that enough was enough, and, like his role-model Alexander, cut the Gordian Knot. Appointing himself \textit{dictator perpetuo},\footnote{Actually, although he was already dictator, Caesar was only awarded the title \textit{dictator perpetuo} sometime after the adoption of the new calendar. But the spirit, if not quite the letter, of what the Almanacker has written is correct.} he abolished the old calendar, replacing it with a new one which drew on the best practices of the peoples of the ancient world: the Egyptian custom of deriving the calendar purely from the sun, the Greek insight that the length of a solar year was very close to 365\sfrac{$1$}{$4$} days long, and the old Roman names. This calendar, with only the slightest of tinkering, has gone on to be adopted by the whole world.\footnote{This potted history of the Julian Calendar is drawn largely from Plutarch's life of Caesar in \textit{Parallel Lives}.}

\chapter{Principles of the \emph{Almanack}}

\section{The Cyprian Calendar}

The Cyprian Calendar is a reconstruction of the Roman lunisolar calendar which preceded the Julian Calendar. It consists of thirteen months:

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{l l}
        Primilis & (Thirty days)\\
        Sectilis & (Twenty-nine days)\\
        Tertilis & (Thirty days)\\
        Quartilis & (Twenty-nine days)\\
        Quintilis & (Thirty days)\\
        Sextilis & (Twenty-nine days)\\
        September & (Thirty days)\\
        October & (Twenty-nine days)\\
        November & (Thirty days)\\
        December & (Twenty-nine days)\\
        Unodecember & (Thirty days)\\
        Duodecember & (Twenty-nine or thirty days)\\
        Intercalaris & (Adjusted)
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The first day of each year, I Pri, i.e. the first day of Primilis, is defined as beginning at sunset preceding the night of the new moon following the spring equinox. Each subsequent day begins at the following sunset. The length of Intercalaris is adjusted each year to ensure that the next I Pri falls on the correct day.

The ``King of Cyprus''\footnote{The Almanacker has only picked on Cyprus because there was once a Christian noble family which legitimately claimed the title ``King of Cyprus'', but the House of Lusignan has since died out.} determines when I Pri ought to fall. Years are lettered according to the reign of the current King of Cyprus. Thus the first year of Thomas, the Almanacker's own name, is $\mathfrak{T}_1$, the second of the same, $\mathfrak{T}_2$, etc. If there was a King of Cyprus called John, the first year of his reign would be lettered $\mathfrak{J}_1$; if Timothy, then $\mathfrak{Ti}_1$. If there was a second King of Cyprus called Thomas, he would be known as Thomas II, and the first year of his reign would be lettered $\mathfrak{T}^\text{II}_1$.

Now in the two thousand and fourteenth year of the New Style, the  vernal equinox occurred at three minutes to five in the afternoon of the twentieth day of March, i.e. 20 Mar 2014 (NS), and the subsequent new moon and sunset occurred at 1948 30 Mar and 1932 31 Mar respectively. Thus Year $\mathfrak{T}_1$ of the Cyprian Calendar began at sunset on that day, i.e.

\[\text{I Pri $\mathfrak{T}_1$} \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
\text{began at sunset on 31 Mar 2014 (NS)}\\
\text{ended at sunset on 01 Apr 2014 (NS)}
\end{array}
\right.
\]

Thus it can calculated that the Cyprian Calendar will follow the Hebrew Calendar until at least 2114 (NS), by which time the Almanacker will have occupied his grave a good few years. The Cyprian date of any given day can be calculated using the number of the Hebrew date of that day, and using the following table to convert the month:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l}
        Primilis &= $ $ Nisan\\
        Sectilis &= $ $ Iyar\\
        Tertilis &= $ $ Sivan\\
        Quartilis &= $ $ Tammuz\\
        Quintilis &= $ $ Av\\
        Sextilis &= $ $ Elul\\
        September &= $ $ Tishrei\\
        October &= $ $ Cheshvan\\
        November &= $ $ Kislev\\
        December &= $ $ Tevet\\
        Unodecember &= $ $ Shevat\\
        Duodecember &= $ $ Adar \textit{or} Adar'\\
        Intercalaris &= $ $ Adar''
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Its Structure}

The structure of the \textit{Almanack} is the structure of the aforementioned Cyprian Calendar. Now the months are grouped together in accordance with Hippocrates'\footnote{Humourism is given what is probably its first comprehensive treatment in Περί Φύσεως Ανθρώπου (``On the Nature of Man''). This treatise is traditionally attributed to Hippocrates, although Aristotle and others have disputed this attribution.} notion of the four humours, which, although repudiated from a scientific point of view, retains, the Almanacker believes, a certain insight into the psychology of man. The table on the next page ought to make things clear.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}\textsc{Month} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}\textsc{Humour} & \multicolumn{1}{c}\textsc{Mood} \\ \hline \hline
        Primilis & & \\
        Sectilis & Yellow bile & Pride, ambition, energy \\
        Tertilis & & \\ \hline
        Quartilis & & \\
        Quintilis & Blood & Joy, friendliness, warmth \\
        Sextilis & & \\ \hline
        September & & \\
        October & Phlegm & Serenity, faith, acceptance \\
        November & & \\ \hline
        December & & \\
        Unodecember & Black bile & Sadness, despair, compassion \\
        Duodecember & & \\ \hline
        Intercalaris & None & -----
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The poetry selected for a given day is to correspond to the mood of the time of year. Furthermore, there is to be a continuity of mood, so that, for example, Tertilis is to be characterised by energy mixed with a little warmth, whereas Quartilis is to be characterised by warmth mixed with a little energy.

Now the entry in the \textit{Almanack} for each day shall consist of three elements:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{A longer poem, called the \textit{song};}
    \item{A shorter poem, called the \textit{sonnet}; and,}
    \item{A proverb.}
\end{enumerate}

For the sake of argument, a sonnet is defined as consisting of not more than fourteen standard lines -- a standard line being a line of iambic pentameter\footnote{Iambic pentameter being the metre in which the vast majority of Shakespeare's works are written. E.g. `Now is the winter of our discontent' would be a standard line.} -- whereas a song is anything longer.

\section{The Selection of Its Contents}

\subsection{Essay on Criticism}

It's a shame that his poetry belongs to the second, and not quite the first, rank of English poetry; for the Almanacker has a great deal of affection for Basil Bunting. Both spent a brief period at a certain Quaker school in the West Riding of Yorkshire\footnote{That is, Ackworth School.} which nevertheless made a permanent and kindly impression on their approaches to literature. Bunting's short essay, `The Poet's Point of View', expresses such a wise and truthful perspective on literary criticism that it's worthy of extensive quotation:
  
\begin{quote}
    Poetry, like music, is to be heard. It deals in sound -- long sounds and short sounds, heavy beats and light beats, the tone relations of vowels, the relations of consonants to one another which are like instrumental colour in music. Poetry lies dead on the page, until some voice brings it to life, just as music, on the stave, is no more than instructions to the player. A skilled musician can imagine the sound, more or less, and a skilled reader can try to hear, mentally, what his eyes see in print: but nothing will satisfy either of them till his ears hear it as real sound in the air. Poetry must be read aloud.

    Reading in silence is the source of half the misconceptions that have caused the public to mistrust poetry. Without the sound, the reader looks at the lines as he looks at prose, seeking a meaning. Prose exists to convey meaning, and no meaning such as prose conveys can be expressed as well in poetry. That is not poetry's business.

    Poetry is seeking to create, not meaning, but beauty; or if you insist on misusing words, its ``meaning'' is of another kind, and lies in the relation to one another of lines and patterns of sound, perhaps harmonious, perhaps contrasting and clashing, which the hearer feels rather than understands, lines of sound drawn in the air which stir deep emotions which may not even have a name in prose. This needs no explaining to an audience which gets its poetry by ear. It has neither time nor inclination to seek a prose meaning in poetry.

    Very few artists have clear, analytical minds. They do what they do because they must. Some think about it afterwards in a muddled way and try unskilfully to reason about their art. Thus theories are produced which mislead critics and tyros, and sometimes disfigure the work of artists who try to carry out their own theories.

    There is no need of any theory for that which gives pleasure through the ear, music or poetry. The theoreticians will follow the artist and fail to explain him.
\end{quote}

Bunting then goes on to say certain things with which the Almanacker cannot agree, and so let's skip ahead to where the two are next of one mind:\footnote{But for anyone who wishes to read the unexpurgated version of his essay, it can be found in the Bloodaxe Books edition of \textit{Briggflatts} (2009).}

\begin{quote}
    Do not let the people who set examinations kid you that you are any nearer to understanding a poem when you have parsed and analysed every sentence, scanned every line, looked up the words in the Oxford Dictionary and the allusions in a library of reference books. That sort of knowledge will make it harder to understand the poem because, when you listen to it, you will be distracted by a multitude of irrelevant scraps of knowledge. You will not hear the meaning, which is in the sound.

    All the arts are plagued by charlatans seeking money, or fame, or just an excuse to idle. The less the public understands the art, the easier it is for charlatans to flourish. Since poetry reading became popular, they have found a new field, and it is not easy for an outsider to distinguish a fraud from a poet. But it is a little less difficult when poetry is read aloud. Claptrap work soon bores. Threadbare work soon sounds thin and broken backed.

    There were mountebanks at the first Albert Hall meeting, as well as a poet or two, but the worst, most insidious charlatans fill chairs and fellowships at universities, write for the weeklies or work for the BBC or the British Council or some other asylum for obsequious idlers. In the eighteenth century it was the church. If these men had to read aloud in public, their empty lines, without resonance, would soon give them away.
\end{quote}

Being Bunting's disciple, the Almanacker must insist that the \textit{Sitz im Leben}\footnote{That is, \textit{situation in life}.} for which this \textit{Almanack} was devised is that the song for a given day should be read aloud -- or, where a tune is indicated, sung -- in front of a small group of people as a kind of grace before the main meal of the day. (The other material for that day may be read out at some other time.) Hopefully this will allow the poems to be shown off in the best light.

\subsection{Permanence}

Of all the definitions of a poem that the Almanacker has come across, the most convincing is, `A linguistic device for making itself remembered.' Thus we have our next Rule:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{Permanence}
    \begin{quote}
        When selecting poetry for the \textit{Almanack}, the primary test for discerning the best poetry is its persistence in the reader's memory.
    \end{quote}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sources}

The Almanacker has endeavoured to only use as sources for the \textit{Almanack} those books which have earned the lasting affection of the British nation -- e.g. Palgrave's \textit{Golden Treasury}, the King James Bible, Shakespeare's \textit{Complete Works}, etc -- and only, as a last resort, to use less cherished texts.

The Almanacker has taken the liberty of amending those passages which seemed to cry out for as much. For example, in 1 Corinthians 13 I've substituted \textit{love} where the KJV puts `charity'. All such amendments are indicated in the footnotes. I've also converted certain unfamiliar proper nouns into more familiar forms. For example, I've substituted \textit{Lebanon} for the \textit{BCP}'s `Libanus'. In all the amendments I've made, I've tried to change the original texts as little as possible, only correcting what seemed to be the most egregious faults.

\subsection{Religion}

Religious poetry of course makes up a sizable portion of the best English literature, but the Almanacker has wished to avoid his work becoming the property of any particular faith. The Almanacker distinguishes between Natural Religion and Revealed Religion; the former arises from the \textit{Urmonotheismus}\footnote{This term was coined by anthropologist Wilhelm Schmidt in his twelve volume masterpiece, \textit{Der Ursprung der Gottesidee} (``The Origin of the Idea of God'') wherein he concludes that belief in one almighty Sky-Father is instrinsic to human life.} which all cultures and times have in common, whereas the latter claims a special knowledge of the divine.

The Almanacker has judged that poetry expressing Natural Religion is to be considered for the \textit{Almanack}, but poetry expressing Revealed Religion is not. This is not to denigrate Revealed Religion, but rather to recognise that great literature concerns the whole world, and not any sect in particular. So we have another Rule:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{\it Urmonotheismus}
    \begin{quote}
        Poetry expressing Natural Religion is to be considered for the \textit{Almanack}, but poetry expressing Revealed Religion is not.
    \end{quote}
\end{figure}

\section{Orthography \& Typography}

\subsection{Orthography}

In accordance with Rule 1, the spellings followed in the \textit{Almanack} are those of Johnson's \textit{Dictionary}, except where so doing would obviously be barbarous.

This involves, most notably, modifying some of the poems of Robert Burns as they are commonly received. Thus `auld' becomes `old' and `pou'd' becomes `pu'd', whereas `tak'' stays `tak'' and `fiere' stays `fiere'; in the former case, the only divergence from Johnson's spelling is a matter of apostrophes, which are allowed, and, in the latter, `fiere' is sufficiently different from its Johnsonian equivalent \textit{friend} to count as another word.

None of this has anything to do with belittling the Scots or any other people; Burns is treated in exactly the same way as Barnes.\footnote{The Rev William Barnes was an English poet who wrote in the Dorset dialect.} Thus we have our last Rule:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{Burns and Barnes}
    \begin{quote}
        The spellings of the \textit{Almanack} are to follow Johnson's \textit{Dictionary}, except in those cases where so doing would clearly inflict violence on the text, i.e. where the spelling is so different that a different word has effectively been formed.
    \end{quote}
\end{figure}

Where the spelling has been altered in the transmission of a text from the source to the \textit{Almanack}, a zeta ($\zeta$) is to be placed in the footnotes for that poem or proverb. If two or more words are altered in a single poem, a xi ($\xi$) is to be inserted.

If a word not found in Johnson's \textit{Dictionary} is present in a text, a dagger ($\dagger$) is to be placed in the footnotes, with a corresponding entry in the `Supplement to Johnson's \textit{Dictionary}' found in the back matter of the \textit{Almanack}. If two or more such words are to be found in a single poem, a double dagger ($\ddagger$) is to be inserted.

The reader will notice that the Almanacker prefers Johnson's \textit{almanack} to the OED's \textit{almanac}, but, otherwise, the spelling in the introductory front matter of the \textit{Almanack} is to follow the OED.

\subsection{Typography}

The Almanacker has elected to adopt the following conventions in the poetry of the \textit{Almanack}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Capitalisation is to be according to the Italian style, i.e. \textit{october} rather than \textit{October}, \textit{english} rather than \textit{English}; but \textit{Matthew}, \textit{Mark} and \textit{England} remain as they are.}
    \item{The names of people are to be printed in \textit{italics}.}
    \item{The names of places are to be printed in {\sc small capitals}.}
    \item{Names which, in prose, would be printed in italics (such as the names of books) are to be printed in {\hoskeroe Old English}.}
    \item{Except where it joins two clauses or begins a line or sentence, or where an especially loose or discordant union is indicated, the word \textit{and} is to be replaced with \textit{\&}.}
\end{itemize}

Changes to punctuation, except where such a change would alter the meaning of the text, are to pass unremarked.

The tetragrammaton, where it appears in the King James Version of the Holy Bible, I have generally rendered as {\hoskeroe LORD}. This follows a precedent set by the Septuagint, the Vulgate and, indeed, the King James Version itself. Unfortunately, the authors of the Old Testament were wont to use a construction which, translated literally, would be rendered as \textit{the Lord YHWH}. If we were to follow the same rule here as before, we would be left with \textit{the Lord {\hoskeroe LORD}}, which is gratuitously ugly. In such cases, I have followed the King James Version, and rendered the tetragrammaton as {\hoskeroe GOD}. The tetragrammaton also appears in the \textit{Book of Common Prayer}'s translation of the Psalms. However, this translation was made according to a different set of rules than the King James Version's strict word-for-word translation philosophy, and, in any case, the tetragrammaton is not marked in any special way in the original text.

Words attributed to Christ himself in any of the four gospels are printed in \textcolor{red}{red}.

\section{Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs}

The Almanacker has also included a translation\footnote{This is generally the King James Version, but the text has been amended to conform with either the Revised Version or Revised Standard Version where one of those two versions gave a more plausible or more beautiful reading. Any verse which has been amended in this way is marked with a printer's fist (\ding{43}).} of Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs. These two marvellous little books are to be read on a shorter cycle than the rest of the \textit{Almanack}, as explained in the following table:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption*{{\sc Table.} Reading Cycles for Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs}
    \begin{tabular}{p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{4cm}}
        \textsc{Book} & \textsc{Divisions} & \textsc{To be read every...}\\ \hline \hline
        Ecclesiastes & 30 & Cyprian month\\ \hline
        Song of Songs & 8 & Cyprian week
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For Ecclesiastes: in months of twenty-nine days, the thirtieth division is to be omitted.

For the Song of Songs: Each Cyprian month is split into four Cyprian weeks, i.e. from the first day to the seventh day, the first week; from the eighth day to the fourteenth day, the second week; from the fifteenth day to the twenty-first day, the third week; from the twenty-second day to the end of the month, the fourth and final week. The eighth division is only to read during the last week of each Cyprian month. In months of thirty days, i.e. when the last week of the month contains nine days, silent reflection is to be allotted on the ninth day where a portion of the Song of Solomon would otherwise be read.

\section{Procedure for Making Suggestions to the Almanacker}

To whichever hands this book should fall into: please feel free to contact the Almanacker with any general comments or suggestions for the inclusion of a particular poem or song. He can be reached at \url{tomdothosker@gmail.com}.

All enquiries will be read sympathetically.

\section{Final Exhortation}

This life is very short, but nonetheless `is attended with so many evils'.\footnote{\cite{bunyan}.} The Almanacker's hope was, in giving the reader regular and easy exposure to the best of English literature, to help him `better to enjoy life, or better to endure it.'\footnote{Dr Johnson, in a review of Soame Jenyns' \emph{Free Enquiry into the Nature of the Origin of Good and Evil}.} Or, as the Very Reverend Dr Donne put it:

\begin{quote}
    \begin{verse}
    Since I am coming to that holy room,\\*
    \vin Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore,\\
    I shall be made thy music; as I come\\
    \vin I tune the instrument here at the door,\\*
    \vin And what I must do then, think here before.\footnote{`Hymn to God, My God, in My Sickness', \emph{Poetical Works}, Ed. by Prof. Sir Herbert Grierson.}
    \end{verse}
\end{quote}

The same score he has in his hand now will be yours and mine soon enough.

By this still hearth, among these barren crags,\\
Matched with an aged wife, I mete \& dole\\
Unequal laws unto a savage race,\\
That hoard \& sleep \& feed, and know not me.\\
I cannot rest from travel: I will drink\\
Life to the lees. All times I have enjoyed\\
Greatly, have suffered greatly, both with those\\
That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when\\
Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades\\
Vexed the dim sea: I am become a name;\\
For always roaming with a hungry heart\\
Much have I seen and known; cities of men\\
And manners, climates, councils, governments,\\
Myself not least, but honoured of them all;\\
And drunk delight of battle with my peers,\\
Far on the ringing plains of windy \textsc{Troy}.\\
I am a part of all that I have met;\\
Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough\\
Gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades\\
For ever \& forever when I move.\\
How dull it is to pause, to make an end,\\
To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!\\
As though to breathe were life! Life piled on life\\
Were all too little, and of one to me\\
Little remains: but every hour is saved\\
From that eternal silence, something more,\\
A bringer of new things; and vile it were\\
For some three suns to store \& hoard myself,\\
And this grey spirit yearning in desire\\
To follow knowledge like a sinking star,\\*
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.\\!

This is my son, mine own \textit{Telemachus},\\*
To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle --\\
Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil\\
This labour, by slow prudence to make mild\\
A rugged people, and through soft degrees\\
Subdue them to the useful \& the good.\\
Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere\\
Of common duties, decent not to fail\\
In offices of tenderness, and pay\\
Meet adoration to my household gods,\\*
When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.\\!

There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail:\\*
There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,\\
Souls that have toiled \& wrought \& thought with me --\\
That ever with a frolic welcome took\\
The thunder \& the sunshine, and opposed\\
Free hearts, free foreheads -- you \& I are old;\\
Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;\\
Death closes all: but something ere the end,\\
Some work of noble note, may yet be done,\\
Not unbecoming men that strove with gods.\\
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:\\
The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep\\
Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,\\
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.\\
Push off, and sitting well in order smite\\
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds\\
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\\
Of all the western stars, until I die.\\
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:\\
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\\
And see the great \textit{Achilles}, whom we knew.\\
Though much is taken, much abides; and though\\
We are not now that strength which in old days\\
Moved earth \& heaven, that which we are, we are;\\
One equal temper of heroic hearts,\\
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will\\*
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
That's my last duchess painted on the wall,\\*\footnotetext{`My Last Duchess', Robert Browning (1828 -- 1889), \cite{obev}. The narrator of the poem is Alfonso II of Ferrara. It is likely that the duke was homosexual; he fathered no children despite three marriages, nor was he known ever to have kept a mistress. At the time of her death, it was widely believed that he had had his first wife, the sixteen-year-old Lucrezia de' Medici, of whom Bronzino painted an exquisite portrait, poisoned; although later writers have suggested that she more likely succumbed to tuberculosis.}
Looking as if she were alive. I call\\
That piece a wonder, now; Fr{\`{e}} \textit{Pandolf}'s hands\\
Worked busily a day, and there she stands.\\
Will't please you sit and look at her? I said,\\
`Fra Pandolf' by design, for never read\\
Strangers like you that pictured countenance,\\
The depth \& passion of its earnest glance,\\
But to myself they turned (since none puts by\\
The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)\\
And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,\\
How such a glance came there; so, not the first\\
Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, 'twas not\\
Her husband's presence only, called that spot\\
Of joy into the duchess' cheek; perhaps\\
Fr{\`{e}} \textit{Pandolf} chanced to say, `Her mantle laps\\
Over my lady's wrist too much,' or `Paint\\
Must never hope to reproduce the faint\\
Half-flush that dies along her throat.' Such stuff\\
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough\\
For calling up that spot of joy. She had\\
A heart -- how shall I say? -- too soon made glad,\\
Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er\\
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.\\
Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her breast,\\
The dropping of the daylight in the west,\\
The bough of cherries some officious fool\\
Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule\\
She rode with round the terrace -- all \& each\\
Would draw from her alike the approving speech,\\
Or blush, at least. She thanked men -- good! But thanked\\
Somehow -- I know not how -- as if she ranked\\
My gift of a 900-years-old name\\
With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to blame\\
This sort of trifling? Even had you skill\\
In speech -- which I have not -- to make your will\\
Quite clear to such an one, and say, `Just this\\
Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,\\
Or there exceed the mark'' -- and if she let\\
Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set\\
Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse --\\
E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose\\
Never to stoop. O sir, she smiled, no doubt,\\
Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without\\
Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;\\
Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands\\
As if alive. Will't please you rise? We'll meet\\
The company below, then. I repeat,\\
The Count your master's known munificence\\
Is ample warrant that no just pretense\\
Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;\\
Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowed\\
At starting, is my object. Nay, we'll go\\
Together down, sir. Notice \textit{Neptune}, though,\\
Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,\\*
Which \textit{Claus of Innsbruck} cast in bronze for me!

Xanadu = Shangdu, summer capital of the Yuan dynasty. Kubla Khan = Kublai Khan, fifth Khagan of the Mongol Empire and first Yuan Emperor of China.}

With walls \& towers were girdled round;\\
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,\\
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;\\
And here were forests ancient as the hills,\\*
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.\\!

But O that deep romantic chasm which slanted\\*
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!\\
A savage place, as holy \& enchanted\\
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted\\
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!\\
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,\\
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,\\
A mighty fountain momently was forced:\\
Amid whose swift \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} intermitted burst\\
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,\\
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:\\
And mid these dancing rocks at once \& ever\\
It flung up momently the sacred river.\\
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion\\
Through wood \& dale the sacred river ran,\\
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,\\
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;\\
And mid this tumult \textit{Kubla} heard from far\\
Ancestral voices prophesying war!\\
{\vin} The shadow of the dome of pleasure\\
{\vin} Floated midway on the waves;\\
{\vin} Where was heard the mingled measure\\
{\vin} From the fountain and the caves.\\
It was a miracle of rare device,\\*
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!\\!

{\vin} A damsel with a dulcimer\\*
{\vin} In a vision once I saw:\\
{\vin} It was an abyssinian maid\\
{\vin} And on her dulcimer she played,\\
{\vin} Singing of Mount \textsc{Abora}.\\
{\vin} Could I revive within me\\
{\vin} Her symphony \& song,\\
{\vin} To such a deep delight 'twould win me,\\
That with music loud \& long,\\
I would build that dome in air,\\
That sunny dome! Those caves of ice!\\
And all who heard should see them there,\\
And all should cry, `Beware! Beware!\\
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!'\\
Weave a circle round him thrice,\\
And close your eyes with holy dread\\
For he on honey-dew hath fed,\\*
And drunk the milk of paradise.

Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime\\

His earthly soul may covet theirs, not them:\\
Like pictures, or like books' gay coverings made\\
For laymen, are all women thus arrayed.\\
Themselves are mystic books, which only we\\
(Whom their imputed grace will dignify)\\
Must see revealed. Then, since that I may know,\\
As liberally as to a midwife show\\
Thyself. Cast all, yea, this white linen hence;\\*
There is no penance due to innocence.\\!

Broad \& thrice new-tilled in that heavenly shield,\\
Where many ploughmen turned up here \& there\\
The earth in furrows, and their sovereign near\\
They strived to work; and every furrow ended\\
A bowl of sweetest wine he still extended\\
To him that first had done, then turned they hand,\\
Desirous to dispatch that piece of land,\\
Deep \& new-eared; black grew the plough with mould\\
Which looked like blackish earth though forged of gold.\\
And this he did with miracle adorn.\\
Then made he grow a field of high-sprung corn,\\
In which did reapers sharpened sickles ply;\\
Others, their handles fall'n confusedly,\\
Laid on the ridge together; others bound\\
Their gathered handfuls to sheaves hard \& round.\\
Their binders were appointed for the place,\\
And at their heels did children glean apace,\\
Whole armfuls to the binders ministering.\\
Amongst all these all silent stood their king.\\
Upon a balk, his sceptre in his hand,\\
Glad at his heart to see his yieldy land.\\
The heralds then the harvest feast prepare,\\
Beneath an oak far off, and for their fare,\\
A mighty ox was slain, and women dressed\\
Store of white cakes, and mixed the labourers' feast\\
In it besides a vine ye might behold\\
Loaded with grapes, the leaves were all of gold.\\
The bunches black \& thick did through it grow\\
And silver props sustained them from below:\\
About the vine an azure dyke was wrought\\
And about it a hedge of tin he brought.\\
One path went through it, through the which did pass\\
The vintagers, when ripe their vintage was.\\
The virgins then, \& youths, childishly wise,\\
For the sweet fruit did painted cups devise,\\
And in a circle bore them dancing round,\\
In midst whereof a boy did sweetly sound\\
His silver harp, and with a piercing voice,\\
Sung a sweet song; when each youth with his choice\\
Triumphing over earth, quick dances treads.\\
A herd of oxen thrusting out their heads\\
And bellowing, from their stalls rushing to feed\\
Near a swift flood, raging and crowned with reed,\\
In gold and tin he carv\`{e}d next the vine\\
Four golden herdsmen following: herd-dogs nine\\
Waiting on them; in head of all the herd,\\
Two lions shook a bull, that bellowing, reared\\
In desperate horror, and was dragged away:\\
The dogs \& youths pursued; but their slain prey,\\
The lions rent out of his spacious hide,\\
And in their entrails did his flesh divide,\\
Lapping his sable blood; the men to fight\\
Set on their dogs in vain that durst not bite,\\
But barked \& backwards flew: he forged beside\\
In a fair vale, a pasture sweet \& wide\\
Of white-fleeced sheep, in which he did impress\\
Sheepcots, sheepfolds \& covered cottages.\\
In this rare shield the famous \textit{Vulcan} cast\\
A dancing mace; like that in ages past,\\
Which in broad \textsc{Knossos} \textit{Daedalus} did dress\\*
For \textit{Ariadne} with the golden tress.

Who are these from the strange ineffable places,\\*\footnotetext{`Arabia', John Falkner (1858 -- 1932), \cite{oxfordlarkin}. The poem has the subtitle: `[David George] Hogarth's \textit{Penetration of Arabia}'. \P 9. This poem contains a number of intriguingly obscure references, beginning with a roll-call of significant -- though now largely forgotten -- European explorers. Jean Louis Burckhardt (1784 -- 1817) was a Swiss explorer and the first European to set eyes on the city of Petra in over a thousand years. Joseph Hal\'evy (1827 -- 1917) was an Ottoman-French-Jewish orientalist who was most notable for his exploration of the Yemen. Karsten Niebuhr (1733 -- 1815) was the cartographer of the Royal Danish Arabian Expedition, and the only member of that group to return to Europe alive. Ulrich Jasper Seetzen (1767 -- 1811) was murdered as an infidel by his fellow Muslims -- he had undertaken an apparently sincere conversion two years before -- while in search of the lost city that Burckhardt would finally rediscover. George Sadleir (1789 -- 1859) was a captain in the British Army who, in endeavouring (successfully) to deliver a ceremonial sword to an Egyptian commander on behalf of Queen Victoria, inadvertently became the first European to cross the Arabia Peninsula. Jan Jansz Struys (1630 -- 1694) was a Dutch sailor more famous for exploring Russia, but who, as prisoner of war in the Ottoman Empire, must have seen more of the Middle East than most Europeans of his day. The exact Slater being referred to, however, remains unclear. \P 17. The location of Samna is likewise unclear. Is this perhaps an archaic name for -- or a garbled version of -- Sana'a? \P 24. Zob\"eide is an archaic romanisation of {\arabicish زبيدة}, now more commonly transliterated as Zubaidah, the granddaughter, niece and wife of three distinct Abbasid caliphs, famous for constructing a series of aqueducts for Mecca and Medina.}

But falls into abatement \& low price,\\
Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy\\*

Now is the winter of our discontent\\*\footnotetext{$\mathbb{R}$ William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616), \cite{obev}. These are the opening lines of \textit{Richard III}, spoken by the eponymous villain, who at this time is Duke of Gloucester. \P 2. The sun in splendour was, with the white rose, one of the symbols of the House of York. There is also a pun here, since Edward IV, the man being praised, was the eldest surviving son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York.}
Made glorious summer by this sun of \textit{York};\\
And all the clouds that loured upon our house\\
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\\
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\\
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;\\
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,\\
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.\\
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;\\
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds\\
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\\
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber\\
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\\
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,\\
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;\\
I, that am rudely stamped, and want love's majesty\\
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;\\
I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,\\
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,\\
Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time\\
Into this breathing world, scarce \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} made up,\\
And that so lamely \& unfashionable\\
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;\\
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\\
Have no delight to pass away the time,\\
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun\\
And descant on mine own deformity:\\
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,\\
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,\\
I am determined to prove a villain\\
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.\\
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\\
By drunken prophecies, libels \& dreams,\\
To set my brother \textit{Clarence} and the King\\
In deadly hate the one against the other:\\
And if King \textit{Edward} be as true \& just\\
As I am subtle, false \& treacherous,\\
This day should \textit{Clarence} closely be mewed up,\\
About a prophecy, which says that \textit{G}\\
Of \textit{Edward}'s heirs the murderer shall be.\\*
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here \textit{Clarence} comes.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
There is no thing in all the world but love,\\*\footnotetext{`The Camel Rider', Wilfrid Blunt (1840 -- 1922), \cite{faber20th}.}
No jubilant thing of sun or shade worth one sad tear.\\
Why dost thou ask my lips to fashion songs\\*
Other than this, my song of love to thee?\\!

See where I lie and pluck the thorns of grief,\\*
Dust on my head and fire, as one who mourns his slain.\\
Are they not slain, my treasures of dear peace?\\*
This their red burial is, sand heaped on sand.\\!

Here came I in the morning of my joys.\\*
Before the dawn was born, through the dark downs I rode.\\
The low stars led me on as with a voice,\\*
Stars of the scorpion's tail in the deep Ssouth.\\!

Sighing I came, and scattering wide the sand.\\*
No need had I to urge her speed with hand or heel,\\
The creature I bestrode. She knew my haste,\\*
And knew the road I sought, the road to thee.\\!

Jangling her bells aloud in wantonness,\\*
And sighing soft, she too, her sighs to my soul's sighs.\\
Behind us the wind followed thick with scents\\*
Of incense blossoms \& the dews of night.\\!

The thorn trees caught at us with their crook'd hands;\\*
The hills in blackness hemmed us in and hid the road;\\
The spectres of the desert howled and warned;\\*
I heeded nothing of their words of woe.\\!

Thus till the dawn I sped in my desire,\\*
Breasting the ridges, slope on slope, till morning broke;\\
And lo, the sun revealed to me no sign,\\*
And lo, the day was widowed of my hope.\\!

Where are the tents of pleasure \& dear love,\\*
Set in the vale of thyme, where winds in spring are fain?\\
The highways of the valley, where they stood\\*
Strong in their flocks, are there. But where are they?\\!

The plain was dumb, as emptied of all voice;\\*
No bleat of herds, no camels roaring far below\\
Told of their presence in the pastures void,\\*
Of the waste places which had been their homes.\\!

I climbed down from my watch-tower of the rocks,\\*
To where the tamarisks grow, \& the dwarf palms, alarmed.\\
I called them with my voice, as the deer calls,\\*
Whose young the wolves have hunted from their place.\\!

I sought them in the foldings of the hill,\\*
In the deep hollows shut with rocks, where no winds blow.\\
I sought their footstep under the tall cliffs,\\*
Shut from the storms, where the first lambs are born.\\!

The tamarisk boughs had blossomed in the night,\\*
And the white broom which bees had found, the wild bees' brood.\\
But no dear signal told me of their life,\\*
No spray was torn in all that world of flowers.\\!

Where are the tents of pleasure \& dear love,\\*
For which my soul took ease for its delight in spring,\\
The black tents of her people beautiful\\*
Beyond the beauty of the sons of kings?\\!

The wind of war has swept them from their place,\\*
Scattering them wide as quails, whom the hawk's hate pursues;\\
The terror of the sword importunate\\*
Was at their backs, nor spared them as they flew.\\!

The summer wind has passed upon their fields;\\*
The rain has purged their hearth-stones, and made smooth their floors;\\
Low in the valley lie their broken spears,\\*
And the white bones which are their tale forlorn.\\!

Where are the sons of Saba in the south,\\*
The men of mirth \& pride to whom my songs were sung,\\
The kinsmen of her soul who is my soul,\\*
The brethren of her beauty whom I love?\\!

She mounted her tall camel in the waste,\\*
Loading it high for flight with her most precious things;\\
She went forth weeping in the wilderness,\\*
Alone with fear on that far night of ill.\\!

She fled mistrusting, as the wild roe flees,\\*
Turning her eyes behind her, while fear fled before;\\
No other refuge knew she than her speed,\\*
And the black land that lies where night is born.\\!

Under what canopy of sulphurous heaven,\\*
Dark with the thunderclouds unloosing their mad tongues,\\
Didst thou lie down aweary of thy burden,\\*
In that dread place of silence thou hadst won?\\!

Close to what shelter of what naked rocks,\\*
Carved with what names of terror of what kings of old,\\
Near to what monstrous shapes unmerciful,\\*
Watching thy death, didst thou give up thy soul?\\!

Or dost thou live by some forgotten well,\\*
Waiting thy day of ransom to return and smile,\\
As the birds come when spring is in the heaven,\\*
And dost thou watch me near while I am blind?\\!

Blind in my tears, because I only weep,\\*
Kindling my soul to fire because I mourn my slain,\\
My kindred slain, and thee, \& my dear peace,\\*
Making their burial thus, sand heaped on sand.\\!

For see, there nothing is in all the world\\*
But only love worth any strife or song or tear.\\
Ask me not then to sing or fashion songs\\*
Other than this, my song of love to thee.

\settowidth{\versewidth}{With these two lords wilt thou from Spain be banished.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The masters go abroad to view the town,\\*\footnotetext{$\mathbb{R}$ Sir John Harington (1560 -- 1612), \cite{obev}. A good chunk of explanation is perhaps helpful with respect to this poem. Firstly, these lines are from Sir John's translation of Ludovico Ariosto's \textit{Orlando Furioso}, being XXVIII v.55-65. Before our story begins, two friends, Giocondo and Astolfo (who also happens to be King of Lombardy), go on a kind of lads' holiday, seducing numerous women -- they aim for a thousand each -- in order to console themselves over their wives' infidelity. Believing no single man of being able to satisfy a woman's lust, they form a kind of polyandrous marriage with an innkeeper's daughter, Fiametta, who sleeps each night between the two men. In the lines here printed, Fiametta happens to bump into her Greek childhood sweetheart. The two wish to start a life together; however, Fiametta, being taken, comes up with a consolation prize. She tells her Greek paramour to sneak into her room and make love to her, and tricks both Giacondo and Astolfo into believing that the other is enjoying her instead. After these lines end, the two friends discover Fiametta's infidelity after the fact, but take being re-cuckolded with a surprisingly robust sense of humour, and allow her and the Greek to get married.}
{\vin} And first the churches for devotions' sake;\\
And then the monuments of most renown,\\
{\vin} As travellers a common custom take:\\
The girl within the chamber sate her down;\\
{\vin} The men are busied; some the beds do make;\\
Some care to dress their wearied horse, and some\\*
Make ready meat against their masters come.\\!

In this same house the girl a greek had spied,\\*
{\vin} That in her father's house a boy had been,\\
And slept full often sweetly by her side,\\
{\vin} And much good sport had pass\`{e}d them between;\\
Yet fearing lest their love should be descried,\\
{\vin} In open talk they durst not to be seen,\\
But when by hap the pages down were gone,\\*
Old love renewed and thus they talk thereon.\\!

The greek demands her whither she was going,\\*
{\vin} And which of these two great estates her keeps.\\
She told them all; she needs no further wooing,\\
{\vin} And how a-night between them both she sleeps:\\
`Ah!' quoth the greek. `Thou tellest my undoing,\\
{\vin} My dear \textit{Fiametta}, and with that he weeps;\\
With these two lords wilt thou from Spain be banished.\\*
Are all my hopes thus into nothing vanished?\\!

`My sweet designments turn\`{e}d are to sour;\\*
{\vin} My service long finds little recompense;\\
I made a stock according to my power,\\
{\vin} By hoarding up my wages, and the pence\\
That guests did give, that came in lucky hour;\\
{\vin} I meant ere long to have departed hence,\\
And to have asked thy sires good will to marry thee,\\*
And that obtained, unto a house to carry thee.'\\!

The wench of her hard fortune doth complain,\\*
{\vin} And saith that now she doubts he sues too late;\\
The greek doth sigh \& sob, and part doth fain.\\
{\vin} `And shall I die,' quoth he, `in this estate?\\
Let me enjoy thy sweetness once again,\\
{\vin} Before my days draw to their doleful date;\\
One small refreshing ere we quite depart\\*
Will make me die with more contented heart.'\\!

The girl with pity mov`ed, thus replies,\\*
{\vin} `Think not,' quoth she, `but I desire the same;\\
But hard it is among so many eyes,\\
{\vin} Without incurring punishment \& shame.'\\
`Ah!' quoth the greek, `some means thou wouldst devise,\\
{\vin} If thou but felt a \sfrac{$1$}{$4$} of my flame,\\
To meet this night in some convenient place,\\*
And be together but a little space.\\!

`Tush!' answered she. `You sue now out of season,\\*
{\vin} For every night I lie betwixt them two\\
And they will quickly fear and find the treason,\\
{\vin} Sith still with one of them I have to do.'\\
`Well,' quoth the greek, `I could refute that reason,\\
{\vin} If you would put your helping hand thereto;\\
You must,' said he, `some pretty 'scuse devise,\\*
And find occasion from them both to rise.'\\!

She first bethinks herself, and after bad\\*
{\vin} He should return when all were sound asleep,\\
And learn\`{e}d him, who was thereof right glad,\\
{\vin} To go \& come, what order he should keep.\\
Now came the greek, as he his lesson had,\\
{\vin} When all was hushed, as soft as he could creep,\\
First to the door, which opened when he pushed,\\*
Then to the chamber, which was softly rushed.\\!

He takes a long \& leisureable stride,\\*
{\vin} And longest on the hinder foot he stayed,\\
So soft he treads, although his steps were wide,\\
{\vin} As though to tread on eggs he were afraid;\\
And as he goes, he gropes on either side\\
{\vin} To find the bed, with hands abroad displayed,\\
And having found the bottom of the bed,\\*
He creepeth in, and forward go'th his head.\\!

Between \textit{Fiametta}'s tender thighs he came,\\*
{\vin} That lay upright, as ready to receive;\\
At last they fell unto their merry game,\\
{\vin} Embracing sweetly now to take their leave;\\
He rode in post, nor can he bait for shame;\\
{\vin} The beast was good, and would not him deceive;\\
He thinks her pace so easy \& so sure,\\*
That all the night to ride he could endure.\\!

\textit{Giocundo} and the king do both perceive\\*
{\vin} The bed to rock, as oft it comes to pass,\\
And both of them one error did deceive,\\
{\vin} For either thought it his companion was:\\
Now hath the greek taken his latter leave,\\
{\vin} And as he came, he back again doth pass,\\
And \textit{Phoebus}' beams did now to shine begin;\\*
\textit{Fiametta} rose and let the pages in.

{\vin} From the seas and the streams;\\
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid\\
{\vin} In their noonday dreams.\\
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken\\
{\vin} The sweet buds every one,\\
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,\\
{\vin} As she dances about the sun.\\
I wield the flail of the lashing hail,\\
{\vin} And whiten the green plains under,\\
And then again I dissolve it in rain,\\*
{\vin} And laugh as I pass in thunder.\\!

I sift the snow on the mountains below,\\*
{\vin} And their great pines groan aghast;\\
And all the night 'tis my pillow white,\\
{\vin} While I sleep in the arms of the blast.\\
Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,\\
{\vin} Lightning my pilot sits;\\
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,\\
{\vin} It struggles and howls at fits;\\
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,\\
{\vin} This pilot is guiding me,\\
Lured by the love of the genii that move\\
{\vin} In the depths of the purple sea;\\
Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills,\\
{\vin} Over the lakes \& the plains,\\
Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,\\
{\vin} The spirit he loves remains;\\
And I all the while bask in heaven's blue smile,\\*
{\vin} Whilst he is dissolving in rains.\\!

The sanguine sunrise, with his meteor eyes,\\*
{\vin} And his burning plumes outspread,\\
Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,\\
{\vin} When the morning star shines dead;\\
As on the jag of a mountain crag,\\
{\vin} Which an earthquake rocks \& swings,\\
An eagle alit one moment may sit\\
{\vin} In the light of its golden wings.\\
And when sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,\\
{\vin} Its ardours of rest \& of love,\\
And the crimson pall of eve may fall\\
{\vin} From the depth of Heaven above,\\
With wings folded I rest, on mine aEDDOTry nest,\\*
{\vin} As still as a brooding dove.\\!

That orb\`{e}d maiden with white fire laden,\\*
{\vin} Whom mortals call the moon,\\
Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,\\
{\vin} By the midnight breezes strewn;\\
And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,\\
{\vin} Which only the angels hear,\\
May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,\\
{\vin} The stars peep behind her and peer;\\
And I laugh to see them whirl \& flee,\\
{\vin} Like a swarm of golden bees,\\
When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,\\
{\vin} Till calm the rivers, lakes, and seas,\\
Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,\\*
{\vin} Are each paved with the moon and these.\\!

I bind the sun's throne with a burning zone,\\*
{\vin} And the moon's with a girdle of pearl;\\
The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel \& swim,\\
{\vin} When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.\\
From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,\\
{\vin} Over a torrent sea,\\
Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof,\\
{\vin} The mountains its columns be.\\
The triumphal arch through which I march\\
{\vin} With hurricane, fire, and snow,\\
When the powers of the air are chained to my chair,\\
{\vin} Is the million-coloured bow;\\
The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove,\\*
{\vin} While the moist earth was laughing below.\\!

I am the daughter of earth \& water,\\*
{\vin} And the nursling of the sky;\\
I pass through the pores of the ocean \& shores;\\
{\vin} I change, but I cannot die.\\
For after the rain when with never a stain\\
{\vin} The pavilion of heaven is bare,\\
And the winds \& sunbeams with their convex gleams\\
{\vin} Build up the blue dome of air,\\
I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,\\
{\vin} And out of the caverns of rain,\\
Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,\\*
{\vin} I arise and unbuild it again.

\settowidth{\versewidth}{A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into that horrid black hole,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
A snake came to my water-trough\\*\footnotetext{`Snake', David Lawrence (1885 -- 1930), \cite{norton}. Lawrence's own note indicates that he wrote this poem in Taormina in 1923.}
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,\\
To drink there.\\
In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob-tree\\
I came down the steps with my pitcher\\*
And must wait, must stand \& wait, for there he was at the trough before me.\\!

He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom\\*
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the edge of the stone trough\\
And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,\\
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,\\
He sipped with his straight mouth,\\
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,\\*
Silently.\\!

Someone was before me at my water-trough,\\*
And I, like a second comer, waiting.\\!

He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,\\*
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,\\
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a moment,\\
And stooped and drank a little more,\\
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the earth\\
On the day of sicilian july, with \textsc{Etna} smoking.\\
The voice of my education said to me,\\
`He must be killed,\\*
For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are venomous.'\\!

And voices in me said, `If you were a man\\*
You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.\\!

But must I confess how I liked him,\\*
How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink at my water-trough\\
And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,\\*
Into the burning bowels of this earth?\\!

Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?\\*
Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?\\
Was it humility, to feel so honoured?\\*
I felt so honoured.\\!

And yet those voices:\\*
If you were not afraid, you would kill him!\\!

And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,\\*
But even so, honoured still more\\
That he should seek my hospitality\\*
From out the dark door of the secret earth.\\!

He drank enough\\*
And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,\\
And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,\\
Seeming to lick his lips,\\
And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,\\
And slowly turned his head,\\
And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,\\
Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round\\*
And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.\\!

And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,\\*
And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders, and entered farther,\\
A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into that horrid black hole,\\
Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself after,\\*
Overcame me now his back was turned.\\!

I looked round, I put down my pitcher,\\*
I picked up a clumsy log\\*
And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.\\!

I think it did not hit him,\\*
But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed in undignified haste.\\
Writhed like lightning, and was gone\\
Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,\\*
At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.\\!

And immediately I regretted it.\\*
I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!\\*
I despised myself \& the voices of my accursed human education.\\!

And I thought of the albatross\\*
And I wished he would come back, my snake.\\!

For he seemed to me again like a king,\\*
Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,\\*
Now due to be crowned again.\\!

And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords\\*
Of life.\\
And I have something to expiate:\\*
A pettiness.

To make self-preservation \& self-protection the first law of existence\\*

The waves, like ridges of ploughed land, are high;\\*\footnotetext{`The Sea Similised to Meadows and Pastures: the Mariners, to Shepherds: the Mast, to a May-Pole: the Fish, to Beasts', Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (1623 -- 1673), \cite{norton}.}
Whereat the ship oft stumbling, down doth lie.\\
But, in a calm, the sea's like meadows seen\\
Level; its saltness makes it look as green.\\
When ships thereon a slow soft pace do walk;\\
Then mariners, as shepherds, sing \& talk:\\
Some whistle, and some on their pipes do play;\\
And thus, with mirth, they pass their time away.\\
And every mast is like a may-pole high,\\
Round which they dance, though not so merrily\\
As shepherds do, when they their lasses bring\\
Garlands, to may-poles tied with a silk string.\\
Instead of garlands, they hang on their mast\\
Huge sails \& ropes, to tie these garlands fast.\\
Instead of lasses, they do dance with death;\\
And for their music, they have \textit{Boreas}' breath.\\
Instead of wine \& wassails, drink salt tears;\\
And for their meat, they feed on nought but fears.\\
For flocks of sheep, great schools of herrings swim;\\
The whales, as ravenous wolves, do feed on them.\\
As sportful kids skip over hillocks green,\\
So dancing dolphins, on the waves are seen.\\
The porpoise, like their watchful dogs espies,\\
And gives them warning when great winds will rise.\\
Instead of barking, he his head doth show\\
Above the waters, when they roughly flow:\\
And, like as men, in time of showering rain\\
And wind, do not in open fields remain;\\
But quickly run for shelter to a tree:\\*
So ships at anchor lie upon the sea.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Had she come all the way for this,\\*\footnotetext{`The Haystack in the Flood', William Morris (1834 -- 1896), \cite{norton}.}
To part at last without a kiss?\\
Yea, had she borne the dirt \& rain\\
That her own eyes might see him slain\\
Beside the haystack in the floods?\\
Along the dripping leafless woods,\\
The stirrup touching either shoe,\\
She rode astride as troopers do;\\
With kirtle kilted to her knee,\\
To which the mud splashed wretchedly;\\
And the wet dripped from every tree\\
Upon her head \& heavy hair,\\
And on her eyelids broad \& fair;\\
The tears \& rain ran down her face.\\
By fits \& starts they rode apace,\\
And very often was his place\\
Far off from her; he had to ride\\
Ahead, to see what might betide\\
When the roads crossed; and sometimes, when\\
There rose a murmuring from his men,\\
Had to turn back with promises;\\
Ah me! she had but little ease;\\
And often for pure doubt \& dread\\
She sobbed, made giddy in the head\\
By the swift riding; while, for cold,\\
Her slender fingers scarce could hold\\
The wet reins; yea, and scarcely, too,\\
She felt the foot within her shoe\\
Against the stirrup : all for this,\\
To part at last without a kiss\\
Beside the haystack in the floods.\\
For when they neared that old soaked hay,\\
They saw across the only way\\
That \textit{Judas}, \textit{Godmar}, and the three.\\
Red running lions dismally\\
Grinned from his pennon, under which,\\
In one straight line along the ditch,\\*
They counted thirty heads.\\!

\textcolor{white}{They counted thirty heads.} So then,\\*
While \textit{Robert} turned round to his men,\\
She saw at once the wretched end,\\
And, stooping down, tried hard to rend\\
Her coif the wrong way from her head,\\
And hid her eyes; while \textit{Robert} said:\\
`Nay, love, 'tis scarcely two to one,\\
At \textsc{Poitiers} where we made them run\\
So fast -- why, sweet my love, good cheer,\\
The gascon frontier is so near,\\*
Nought after this.'\\!

\textcolor{white}{Nought after this.'} But, `O,' she said,\\*
`My God! my God! I have to tread\\
The long way back without you; then\\
The court at \textsc{Paris}; those six men;\\
The gratings of the \textsc{Ch\^{a}telet};\\
The swift \textsc{Seine} on some rainy day\\
Like this, and people standing by,\\
And laughing, while my weak hands try\\
To recollect how strong men swim.\\
All this, or else a life with him,\\
For which I should be damned at last,\\
Would God that this next hour were past!'\\
He answered not, but cried his cry,\\
`St \textit{George} for \textit{Marny}!' cheerily;\\
And laid his hand upon her rein.\\
Alas! no man of all his train\\
Gave back that cheery cry again;\\
And, while for rage his thumb beat fast\\
Upon his sword-hilts, some one cast\\
About his neck a kerchief long,\\*
And bound him.\\!

\textcolor{white}{And bound him.} Then they went along\\*
To \textit{Godmar}; who said: `Now, \textit{Jehane},\\
Your lover's life is on the wane\\
So fast, that, if this very hour\\
You yield not as my paramour,\\
He will not see the rain leave off --\\
Nay, keep your tongue from gibe \& scoff,\\
Sir \textit{Robert}, or I slay you now.'\\
She laid her hand upon her brow,\\
Then gazed upon the palm, as though\\
She thought her forehead bled, and -- `No.'\\
She said, and turned her head away,\\
As there were nothing else to say,\\
And everything were settled: red\\
Grew \textit{Godmar}'s face from chin to head:\\
`\textit{Jehane}, on yonder hill there stands\\
My castle, guarding well my lands:\\
What hinders me from taking you,\\
And doing that I list to do\\
To your fair wilful body, while\\*
Your knight lies dead?'\\!

\textcolor{white}{Your knight lies dead?'} A wicked smile\\*
Wrinkled her face, her lips grew thin,\\
A long way out she thrust her chin: go\\
`You know that I should strangle you\\
While you were sleeping; or bite through\\
Your throat, by God's help -- ah!' she said,\\
`Lord \textit{Jesus}, pity your poor maid!\\
For in such wise they hem me in,\\
I cannot choose but sin \& sin,\\
Whatever happens : yet I think\\
They could not make me eat or drink,\\
And so should I just reach my rest.'\\
`Nay, if you do not my behest,\\
O \textit{Jehane}! though I love you well,'\\
Said \textit{Godmar}, 'would I fail to tell\\
All that I know.' `Foul lies,' she said.\\
`Eh? lies my \textit{Jehane}? by God's head,\\
At \textsc{Paris} folks would deem them true!\\
Do you know, \textit{Jehane}, they cry for you,\\
``\textit{Jehane} the brown! \textit{Jehane} the brown!\\
Give us \textit{Jehane} to bum or drown!'' --\\
Eh -- gag me \textit{Robert}! -- sweet my friend,\\
This were indeed a piteous end no\\
For those long fingers, and long feet,\\
And long neck, and smooth shoulders sweet;\\
An end that few men would forget\\
That saw it. So, an hour yet:\\
Consider, \textit{Jehane}, which to take\\*
Of life or death!'\\!

\textcolor{white}{Of life or death!'} So, scarce awake,\\*
Dismounting, did she leave that place,\\
And totter some yards : with her face\\
Turned upward to the sky she lay,\\
Her head on a wet heap of hay,\\
And fell asleep: and while she slept,\\
And did not dream, the minutes crept\\
Round to the 12 again; but she,\\
Being waked at last, sighed quietly,\\
And strangely childlike came, and said:\\
'I will not.' Straightway \textit{Godmar}'s head,\\
As though it hung on strong wires, turned\\*
Most sharply round, and his face burned.\\!

For \textit{Robert} -- both his eyes were dry,\\*
He could not weep, but gloomily\\
He seemed to watch the rain; yea, too,\\
His lips were firm; he tried once more\\
To touch her lips; she reached out, sore\\
And vain desire so tortured them,\\
The poor grey lips, and now the hem\\*
Of his sleeve brush'd them.\\!

\textcolor{white}{Of his sleeve brush'd them.} With a start\\*
Up \textit{Godmar} rose, thrust them apart;\\
From \textit{Robert}'s throat he loosed the bands\\
Of silk \& mail; with empty hands\\
Held out, she stood \& gazed, and saw,\\
The long bright blade without a flaw\\
Glide out from \textit{Godmar}'s sheath, his hand\\
In \textit{Robert}'s hair; she saw him bend\\
Back \textit{Robert}'s head; she saw him send\\
The thin steel down; the blow told well,\\
Right backward the knight \textit{Robert} fell,\\
And moaned as dogs do, being \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} dead,\\
Unwitting, as I deem : so then\\
\textit{Godmar} turned grinning to his men,\\
Who ran, some five or six, and beat\\*
His head to pieces at their feet.\\!

Then \textit{Godmar} turned again and said:\\*
`So, \textit{Jehane}, the first fitte is read!\\
Take note, my lady, that your way\\
Lies backward to the \textsc{Ch\^{a}telet}!'\\
She shook her head and gazed awhile\\
At her cold hands with a rueful smile,\\*
As though this thing had made her mad.\\!

This was the parting that they had\\*
Beside the haystack in the floods.

Come, take up your hats, and away let us haste\\*\footnotetext{`The Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast', William Roscoe (1753 -- 1831), \cite{obev}.}
To the butterfly's ball \& the grasshopper's feast:\\
The trumpeter gad-fly has summoned the crew,\\*
And the revels are now only waiting for you.\\!

On the smooth-shaven grass by the side of a wood\\*
Beneath a broad oak which for ages has stood,\\
See the children of earth \& the tenants of air\\*
For an evening's amusement together repair.\\!

And there came the beetle so blind \& so black,\\*
Who carried the emmet his friend on his back;\\
And there came the gnat \& the dragonfly too,\\*
And all their relations, green, orange \& blue.\\!

And there came the moth in his plumage of down,\\*
And the hornet in jacket of yellow \& brown,\\
Who with him the wasp his companion did bring;\\*
But they promised that evening to lay by their sting.\\!

And the sly little dormouse crept out of his hole,\\*
And led to the feast his blind brother the mole;\\
And the snail, with his horns peeping out from his shell,\\*
Came from a great distance -- the length of an ell.\\!

A mushroom their table, and on it was laid\\*
A water-dock leaf, which a tablecloth made;\\
The viands were various, to each of their taste,\\*
And the bee brought his honey to crown the repast.\\!

There close on his haunches, so solemn \& wise,\\*
The frog from a corner look'd up to the skies;\\
And the squirrel, well-pleased such diversion to see,\\*
Sat cracking his nuts overhead in a tree.\\!

Then out came a spider, with fingers so fine,\\*
To show his dexterity on the tight-line;\\
From one branch to another his cobweb he slung,\\*
Then as quick as an arrow he darted along.\\!

But just in the middle -- oh, shocking to tell! --\\*
From his rope in an instant poor \textit{Harlequin} fell;\\
Yet he touched not the ground, but with talons outspread,\\*
Hung suspended in air at the end of a thread.\\!

Then the grasshopper came, with a jerk \& a spring,\\*
Very long was his leg, though but short was his wing\\
He took but three leaps, and was soon out of sight,\\*
Then chirped his own praises the rest of the night\\!

With steps quite majestic the snail did advance,\\*
And promis'd the gazers a minuet to dance;\\
But they all laughed so loud that he pulled in his head,\\*
And went in his own little chamber to bed.\\!

Then as evening gave way to the shadows of night,\\*
Their watchman, the glow-worm, came out with his light;\\
Then home let us hasten while yet we can see,\\*
For no watchman is waiting for you \& for me.

There was many the ruction that myself had a han' in.\\
\textit{Bob Williamson} lived there, a weaver by trade,\\
And all of us thought him a stout orange blade.\\
On the 12th of july as it yearly did come,\\
\textit{Bob} played on his old flute to the sound of the drum.\\
You can talk of your harp, your piano or lute,\\*
But nothing compared with the old orange flute.\\!

Ah but \textit{Bob} the deceiver, sure he took us all in,\\*
And he married a papist called \textit{Bridget McGinn},\\
Turned papist himself, and forsook the old cause\\
That gave us our freedom, religion \& laws.\\
Now the boys of the place made some comment upon it,\\
And \textit{Bob} had to flee to the province of Connaught.\\
Well he fled with his wife \& his fixings to boot;\\*
And, along with the latter, his old orange flute.\\!

At the chapel on sundays, to atone for past deeds,\\*
He said paters \& aves and he counted his beads;\\
Till after some time, at the priest's own desire,\\
\textit{Bob} went with his old flute to play in the choir.\\
Well he went with his old flute to play in the mass,\\
But the instrument shivered \& sighed -- O alas --\\
And blow as he would, though it made a great noise,\\*
The flute would play only ``The Protestant Boys''.\\!

At the council of priests that was held the next day,\\*
They decided to banish the old flute away.\\
They couldn't knock heresy out of its head,\\
So they bought \textit{Bob} a new one to play in its stead.\\
Now the old flute it was doomed and its fate was pathetic.\\
'Twas fastened and burned at the stake as heretic.\\
As the flames roared around sure they heard a queer noise;\\*

The phrase `mo mhuirn\'in' is pronounced ``mavourneen'' as in the Irish folk song `Kathleen Mavourneen', and it means ``my darling''; whereas `sail \'eille' (sometimes semi-anglicised as ``shillelagh'') is pronounced to rhyme with ``ukulele'', and refers to a kind of blunt weapon typically made from blackthorn wood. `D'anam don diabhal' is a curse, literally, ``Your soul to the devil''; and it's pronounced something like ``Denim done dowel''.}

He had a brogue both rich \& sweet,\\

They rolled him up in a nice clean sheet,\\

With a bucket of whisky at his feet\\*
{\vin} And a barrel of porter at his head.\\!

\textit{Tim}'s friends assembled at the wake,\\*

Byron notes: `Lachin y Gair, or, as it is pronounced in the Erse, Loch na Garr, towers proudly pre-eminent in the Northern Highlands, near Invercauld. One of our modern tourists mentions it as the highest mountain, perhaps, in Great Britain. Be this as it may, it is certainly one of the most sublime and picturesque amongst our ``Caledonian Alps''. Its appearance is of a dusky hue, but the summit is the seat of eternal snows. Near Lachin y Gair I spent some of the early part of my life, the recollection of which has given birth to these stanzas.'}

I admire it much, and yesterday I set the following verses to it.'' The poet, two years afterwards, altered the fourth line thus: ``Thy Jeany will venture wi' ye, my lad,'' and assigned this reason: ``In fact, a fair dame at whose shrine I, the priest of the Nine, offer up the incense of Parnassus; a dame whom the Graces have attired in witchcraft, and whom the Loves have armed with lightning; a fair one, herself the heroine of the song, insists on the amendment, and dispute her commands if you dare.{''}'}

Musically speaking, the first is an instrument of which the gamut is scanty and confined, but the tones inexpressibly sweet, while the last has powers equal to all the intellectual modulations of the human soul.'' It must be owned that the bard could render very pretty reasons for his rapture about Jean Lorimer.'

Collectors give pumps and halyards alike as the job it was used for. Terry and Whall call it a hauling song; Miss Colcord and Doerflinger give it for pumps. I think they are all right. It was probably sung at halyards with two solos and refrains, and when a full chorus was added then it was used at the pumps and even capstan. I learnt it partly from my mother's father, and he always sang the full chorus, and partly from an old Irish sailor, who also used the final chorus. It probably came to life about the time of the Irish potato famine, in the forties, and was originally sung in the Western Ocean Packets in this fashion... The later version `Leave Her, Johnnies' or as some sang it `Leave Her, Bullies' was sometimes sung during the voyage -- at the pumps -- but its better-known function was that of airing grievances just prior to the completion of the voyage either when warping the vessel in through the locks or at the final spell of the pumps (in wooden ships) after the vessel had docked. Many unprintable stanzas were sung, directed at the afterguard, the grub, and the owners. Bullen writes that ``to sing it before the last day or so was almost tantamount to mutiny.{''}'}

\begin{verse}
When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,\\*\footnotetext{`When Lilacs Last in the Door-Yard Bloom'd', Walt Whitman (1819 -- 1892), \cite{norton}. This poem is an elegy for Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States.}
And the great star early drooped in the western sky in the night,\\*
I mourned, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.\\!

Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,\\*
Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,\\*
And thought of him I love. \aldine\\!

O powerful western fallen star!\\*
O shades of night -- O moody, tearful night!\\
O great star disappeared -- O the black murk that hides the star!\\
O cruel hands that hold me powerless -- O helpless soul of me!\\*
O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.\\!

In the door-yard fronting an old farm-house near the white-washed palings,\\*
Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green,\\
With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I love,\\
With every leaf a miracle—and from this bush in the door-yard,\\
With delicate-coloured blossoms \& heart-shaped leaves of rich green,\\*
A sprig with its flower I break. \aldine\\!

In the swamp in secluded recesses,\\*
A shy \& hidden bird is warbling a song.\\!

Solitary the thrush,\\*
The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,\\*
Sings by himself a song.\\!

Song of the bleeding throat,\\*
Death's outlet song of life, (for well, dear brother, I know,\\*
If thou wast not granted to sing thou would'st surely die). \aldine\\!

Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,\\*
Amid lanes \& through old woods, where lately the violets peeped from the ground, spotting the gray debris,\\
Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the endless grass,\\
Passing the yellow-speared wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprisen,\\
Passing the apple-tree blows of white \& pink in the orchards,\\
Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,\\*
Night \& day journeys a coffin. \aldine\\!

Coffin that passes through lanes \& streets,\\*
Through day \& night with the great cloud darkening the land,\\
With the pomp of the inlooped flags with the cities draped in black,\\
With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veiled women standing,\\
With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night,\\
With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads,\\
With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,\\
With dirges through the night, with the 1000 voices rising strong \& solemn,\\
With all the mournful voices of the dirges poured around the coffin,\\
The dim-lit churches \& the shuddering organs -- where amid these you journey,\\
With the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,\\
Here, coffin that slowly passes,\\*
I give you my sprig of lilac. \aldine\\!

(Nor for you, for one alone,\\*
Blossoms \& branches green to coffins all I bring,\\*
For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you, O sane \& sacred death.\\!

All over bouquets of roses,\\*
O death, I cover you over with roses \& early lilies,\\
But mostly \& now the lilac that blooms the first,\\
Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes,\\
With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,\\*
For you and the coffins all of you, O death.) \aldine\\!

O western orb sailing the heaven,\\*
Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walked,\\
As I walked in silence the transparent shadowy night,\\
As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night,\\
As you drooped from the sky low down as if to my side, (while the other stars all looked on,)\\
As we wandered together the solemn night, (for something I know not what kept me from sleep,)\\
As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you were of woe,\\
As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night,\\
As I watched where you passed and was lost in the nether-ward black of the night,\\
As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you, sad orb,\\*
Concluded, dropped in the night, and was gone. \aldine\\!

Sing on there in the swamp,\\*
O singer bashful \& tender. I hear your notes; I hear your call,\\
I hear, I come presently, I understand you,\\
But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detained me,\\*
The star my departing comrade holds and detains me. \aldine\\!

O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?\\*
And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?\\*
And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?\\!

Sea-winds blown from east \& west,\\*
Blown from the eastern sea and blown from the western sea, till there on the prairies meeting,\\
These \& with these \& the breath of my chant,\\*
I'll perfume the grave of him I love. \aldine\\!

O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?\\*
And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,\\*
To adorn the burial-house of him I love?\\!

Pictures of growing spring \& farms \& homes,\\*
With the fourth-month eve at sundown, \& the grey smoke lucid \& bright,\\
With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air,\\
With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, \& the pale green leaves of the trees prolific,\\
In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here \& there,\\
With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, \& shadows,\\
And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, \& stacks of chimneys,\\*
And all the scenes of life \& the workshops, \& the workmen homeward returning. \aldine\\!

Lo, body \& soul -- this land,\\*
My own \textsc{Manhattan} with spires, and the sparkling \& hurrying tides, and the ships,\\
The varied \& ample land, the south and the north in the light, \textsc{Ohio}'s shores and flashing \textsc{Missouri},\\*
And ever the far-spreading prairies covered with grass \& corn.\\!

Lo, the most excellent sun so calm \& haughty,\\*
The violet \& purple morn with just-felt breezes,\\
The gentle soft-born measureless light,\\
The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfilled noon,\\
The coming eve delicious, the welcome night \& the stars,\\*
Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land. \aldine\\!

Sing on, sing on, you gray-brown bird.\\*
Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes,\\*
Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.\\!

Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,\\*
Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.\\!

O liquid \& free \& tender!\\*
O wild \& loose to my soul -- O wondrous singer!\\
You only I hear -- yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,)\\*
Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me. \aldine\\!

Now while I sat in the day and looked forth,\\*
In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and the farmers preparing their crops,\\
In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes \& forests,\\
In the heavenly aerial beauty (after the perturbed winds and the storms)\\
Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children \& women,\\
The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sailed,\\
And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labour,\\
And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals \& minutiae of daily usages,\\
And the streets how their throbbings throbbed, and the cities pent -- lo, then \& there,\\
Falling upon them all \& among them all, enveloping me with the rest,\\
Appeared the cloud, appeared the long black trail,\\*
And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.\\!

Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,\\*
And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,\\
And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions,\\
I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,\\
Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,\\*
To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.\\!

And the singer so shy to the rest received me,\\*
The grey-brown bird I know received us comrades three,\\*
And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.\\!

From deep secluded recesses,\\*
From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,\\*
Came the carol of the bird.\\!

And the charm of the carol rapt me,\\*
As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,\\*
And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.\\!

Come lovely \& soothing death,\\*
Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,\\
In the day, in the night, to all, to each,\\*
Sooner or later delicate death.\\!

Praised be the fathomless universe,\\*
For life \& joy, and for objects \& knowledge curious,\\
And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise!\\*
For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.\\!

Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,\\*
Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?\\
Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,\\*
I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.\\!

Approach strong deliveress,\\*
When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,\\
Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,\\*
Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O death.\\!

From me to thee glad serenades,\\*
Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments \& feastings for thee,\\
And the sights of the open landscape \& the high-spread sky are fitting,\\*
And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.\\!

The night in silence under many a star,\\*
The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,\\
And the soul turning to thee, O vast \& well-veiled death,\\*
And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.\\!

Over the tree-tops I float thee a song,\\*
Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies wide,\\
Over the dense-packed cities all and the teeming wharves \& ways,\\*
I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee, O death. \aldine\\!

To the tally of my soul,\\*
Loud \& strong kept up the grey-brown bird,\\*
With pure deliberate notes spreading, filling the night.\\!

Loud in the pines \& cedars dim,\\*
Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,\\*
And I with my comrades there in the night.\\!

While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,\\*
As to long panoramas of visions.\\!

And I saw askant the armies;\\*
I saw as in noiseless dreams 100s of battle-flags,\\
Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierced with missiles I saw them,\\
And carried hither \& yon through the smoke, and torn \& bloody,\\
And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,)\\*
And the staffs all splintered and broken.\\!

I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,\\*
And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,\\
I saw the debris \& debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,\\
But I saw they were not as was thought,\\
They themselves were fully at rest; they suffered not;\\
The living remained and suffered; the mother suffered;\\
And the wife \& the child \& the musing comrade suffered,\\*
And the armies that remained suffered. \aldine\\!

Passing the visions, passing the night,\\*
Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands,\\
Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,\\
Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,\\
As low \& wailing, yet clear the notes, rising \& falling, flooding the night,\\
Sadly sinking \& fainting, as warning \& warning, and yet again bursting with joy,\\
Covering the earth \& filling the spread of the heaven,\\
As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,\\
Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,\\*
I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.\\!

I cease from my song for thee,\\*
From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,\\*
O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.\\!

Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,\\*
The song, the wondrous chant of the grey-brown bird,\\
And the tallying chant, the echo aroused in my soul,\\
With the lustrous \& drooping star with the countenance full of woe,\\
With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,\\
Comrades mine \& I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for the dead I loved so well,\\
For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days \& lands -- and this for his dear sake,\\
Lilac \& star \& bird twined with the chant of my soul,\\*
There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk \& dim.

\settowidth{\versewidth}{{\vin} The old man's shape, and speech -- all troubled me:}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
There was a roaring in the wind all night;\\*\footnotetext{`Resolution and Independence', Dr William Wordsworth, Poet Laureate (1770 -- 1850), \cite{norton}.}
{\vin} The rain came heavily and fell in floods;\\
But now the sun is rising calm \& bright;\\
{\vin} The birds are singing in the distant woods;\\
{\vin} Over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods;\\
The jay makes answer as the magpie chatters;\\*
And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters.\\!

All things that love the sun are out of doors;\\*
{\vin} The sky rejoices in the morning's birth;\\
The grass is bright with rain-drops; on the moors\\
{\vin} The hare is running races in her mirth;\\
{\vin} And with her feet she from the plashy earth\\
Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun,\\*
Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run.\\!

I was a traveller then upon the moor;\\*
{\vin} I saw the hare that raced about with joy;\\
I heard the woods and distant waters roar;\\
{\vin} Or heard them not, as happy as a boy:\\
{\vin} The pleasant season did my heart employ:\\
My old remembrances went from me wholly;\\*
And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy.\\!

But, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might\\*
{\vin} Of joys in minds that can no further go,\\
As high as we have mounted in delight\\
{\vin} In our dejection do we sink as low;\\
{\vin} To me that morning did it happen so;\\
And fears and fancies thick upon me came;\\*
Dim sadness -- and blind thoughts, I knew not, nor could name.\\!

I heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky;\\*
{\vin} And I bethought me of the playful hare:\\
Even such a happy child of earth am I;\\
{\vin} Even as these blissful creatures do I fare;\\
{\vin} Far from the world I walk, and from all care;\\
But there may come another day to me --\\*
Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty.\\!

My whole life I have lived in pleasant thought,\\*
{\vin} As if life's business were a summer mood;\\
As if all needful things would come unsought\\
{\vin} To genial faith, still rich in genial good;\\
{\vin} But how can He expect that others should\\
Build for him, sow for him, and at his call\\*
Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all?\\!

I thought of \textit{Chatterton}, the marvellous boy,\\*
{\vin} The sleepless soul that perished in his pride;\\
Of him who walked in glory and in joy\\
{\vin} Following his plough, along the mountain-side:\\
{\vin} By our own spirits are we deified:\\
We Poets in our youth begin in gladness;\\*
But thereof come in the end despondency \& madness.\\!

Now, whether it were by peculiar grace,\\*
{\vin} A leading from above, a something given,\\
Yet it befell that, in this lonely place,\\
{\vin} When I with these untoward thoughts had striven,\\
{\vin} Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven\\
I saw a man before me unawares:\\*
The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.\\!

As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie\\*
{\vin} Couched on the bald top of an eminence;\\
Wonder to all who do the same espy,\\
{\vin} By what means it could thither come, and whence;\\
{\vin} So that it seems a thing endued with sense:\\
Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf\\*
Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself;\\!

Such seemed this man, not all alive nor dead,\\*
{\vin} Nor all asleep -- in his extreme old age:\\
His body was bent double, feet \& head\\
{\vin} Coming together in life's pilgrimage;\\
{\vin} As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage\\
Of sickness felt by him in times long past,\\*
A more than human weight upon his frame had cast.\\!

Himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face,\\*
{\vin} Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood:\\
And, still as I drew near with gentle pace,\\
{\vin} Upon the margin of that moorish flood\\
{\vin} Motionless as a cloud the old Man stood,\\
That heareth not the loud winds when they call,\\*
And moveth all together, if it move at all.\\!

At length, himself unsettling, he the pond\\*
{\vin} Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look\\
Upon the muddy water, which he conned,\\
{\vin} As if he had been reading in a book:\\
{\vin} And now a stranger's privilege I took;\\
And, drawing to his side, to him did say,\\*
`This morning gives us promise of a glorious day.'\\!

A gentle answer did the old man make,\\*
{\vin} In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew:\\
And him with further words I thus bespake,\\
{\vin} `What occupation do you there pursue?\\
{\vin} This is a lonesome place for one like you.'\\
Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise\\*
Broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes.\\!

His words came feebly, from a feeble chest,\\*
{\vin} But each in solemn order followed each,\\
With something of a lofty utterance drest --\\
{\vin} Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach\\
{\vin} Of ordinary men; a stately speech;\\
Such as grave livers do in Scotland use,\\*
Religious men, who give to God and man their dues.\\!

He told, that to these waters he had come\\*
{\vin} To gather leeches, being old and poor:\\
Employment hazardous and wearisome!\\
{\vin} And he had many hardships to endure:\\
{\vin} From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor;\\
Housing, with God's good help, by choice or chance;\\*
And in this way he gained an honest maintenance.\\!

The old man still stood talking by my side;\\*
{\vin} But now his voice to me was like a stream\\
Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide;\\
{\vin} And the whole body of the Man did seem\\
{\vin} Like one whom I had met with in a dream;\\
Or like a man from some far region sent,\\*
To give me human strength, by apt admonishment.\\!

My former thoughts returned: the fear that kills;\\*
{\vin} And hope that is unwilling to be fed;\\
Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills;\\
{\vin} And mighty poets in their misery dead.\\
{\vin} Perplexed, and longing to be comforted,\\
My question eagerly did I renew,\\*
`How is it that you live, and what is it you do?'\\!

He with a smile did then his words repeat;\\*
{\vin} And said that, gathering leeches, far \& wide\\
He travelled; stirring thus about his feet\\
{\vin} The waters of the pools where they abide.\\
{\vin} `Once I could meet with them on every side;\\
But they have dwindled long by slow decay;\\*
Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may.'\\!

While he was talking thus, the lonely place,\\*
{\vin} The old man's shape, and speech -- all troubled me:\\
In my mind's eye I seemed to see him pace\\
{\vin} About the weary moors continually,\\
{\vin} Wandering about alone and silently.\\
While I these thoughts within myself pursued,\\*
He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed.\\!

And soon with this he other matter blended,\\*
{\vin} Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind,\\
But stately in the main; and, when he ended,\\
{\vin} I could have laughed myself to scorn to find\\
{\vin} In that decrepit man so firm a mind.\\
`God,' said I, `be my help and stay secure;\\*
I'll think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!'

Five years have passed; five summers, with the length\\*\footnotetext{`Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, On Revisiting the Banks of the Wye during a Tour, July 13, 1798', Dr William Wordsworth, Poet Laureate (1770 -- 1850), \cite{norton}.}
Of five long winters, and again I hear\\
These waters, rolling from their mountain springs\\
With a soft inland murmur. Once again\\
Do I behold these steep \& lofty cliffs,\\
That on a wild secluded scene impress\\
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect\\
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.\\
The day is come when I again repose\\
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view\\
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,\\
Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,\\
Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves\\
'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see\\
These hedge-rows, hardly hedgerows, little lines\\
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,\\
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke\\
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!\\
With some uncertain notice, as might seem\\
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,\\
Or of some hermit's cave, where by his fire\\
The hermit sits alone. These beauteous forms,\\
Through a long absence, have not been to me\\
As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:\\
But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din\\
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,\\
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,\\
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;\\
And passing even into my purer mind\\
With tranquil restoration: feelings too\\
Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,\\
As have no slight or trivial influence\\
On that best portion of a good man's life,\\
His little, nameless, unremembered, acts\\
Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,\\
To them I may have owed another gift,\\
Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,\\
In which the burthen of the mystery,\\
In which the heavy and the weary weight\\
Of all this unintelligible world,\\
Is lightened: that serene and bless\`{e}d mood,\\
In which the affections gently lead us on,\\
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame\\
And even the motion of our human blood\\
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep\\
In body, and become a living soul:\\
While with an eye made quiet by the power\\
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,\\
We see into the life of things. If this\\
Be but a vain belief, yet, O! how oft\\
In darkness and amid the many shapes\\
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir\\
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,\\
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart\\
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,\\
O sylvan \textsc{Wye}! thou wanderer through the woods,\\*
How often has my spirit turned to thee!\\!

And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,\\*
With many recognitions dim and faint,\\
And somewhat of a sad perplexity,\\
The picture of the mind revives again:\\
While here I stand, not only with the sense\\
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts\\
That in this moment there is life and food\\
For future years. And so I dare to hope,\\
Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first\\
I came among these hills; when like a roe\\
I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides\\
Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,\\
Wherever nature led: more like a man\\
Flying from something that he dreads, than one\\
Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then\\
(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days\\
And their glad animal movements all gone by)\\
To me was all in all. I cannot paint\\
What then I was. The sounding cataract\\
Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,\\
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\\
Their colours and their forms, were then to me\\
An appetite; a feeling and a love,\\
That had no need of a remoter charm,\\
By thought supplied, not any interest\\
Unborrowed from the eye. That time is past,\\
And all its aching joys are now no more,\\
And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this\\
Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts\\
Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,\\
Abundant recompense. For I have learned\\
To look on nature, not as in the hour\\
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes\\
The still sad music of humanity,\\
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power\\
To chasten and subdue. And I have felt\\
A presence that disturbs me with the joy\\
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime\\
Of something far more deeply interfused,\\
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\\
And the round ocean and the living air,\\
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:\\
A motion and a spirit, that impels\\
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,\\
And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still\\
A lover of the meadows \& the woods\\
And mountains; and of all that we behold\\
From this green earth; of all the mighty world\\
Of eye, and ear, both what they half create,\\
And what perceive; well pleased to recognise\\
In nature and the language of the sense\\
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,\\
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul\\
Of all my moral being. Nor perchance,\\
If I were not thus taught, should I the more\\
Suffer my genial spirits to decay:\\
For thou art with me here upon the banks\\
Of this fair river; thou my dearest friend,\\
My dear, dear friend; and in thy voice I catch\\
The language of my former heart, and read\\
My former pleasures in the shooting lights\\
Of thy wild eyes. O! yet a little while\\
May I behold in thee what I was once,\\
My dear, dear sister! and this prayer I make,\\
Knowing that nature never did betray\\
The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,\\
Through all the years of this our life, to lead\\
From joy to joy: for she can so inform\\
The mind that is within us, so impress\\
With quietness and beauty, and so feed\\
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,\\
Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,\\
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all\\
The dreary intercourse of daily life,\\
Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb\\
Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold\\
Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon\\
Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;\\
And let the misty mountain-winds be free\\
To blow against thee: and, in after years,\\
When these wild ecstasies shall be matured\\
Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind\\
Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,\\
Thy memory be as a dwelling-place\\
For all sweet sounds and harmonies; O! then,\\
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,\\
Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts\\
Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,\\
And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance\\
If I should be where I no more can hear\\
Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams\\
Of past existence -- wilt thou then forget\\
That on the banks of this delightful stream\\
We stood together; and that I, so long\\
A worshipper of nature, hither came\\
Unwearied in that service: rather say\\
With warmer love -- O! with far deeper zeal\\
Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,\\
That after many wanderings, many years\\
Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,\\
And this green pastoral landscape, were to me\\*
More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Here, where the world is quiet;\\*\footnotetext{`The Garden of Prosperpine', Algernon Swinburne (1837 -- 1909), \cite{norton}. Proserpine was the consort of Pluto, lord of the underworld.}
{\vin} Here, where all trouble seems\\
Dead winds' \& spent waves' riot\\
{\vin} In doubtful dreams of dreams;\\
I watch the green field growing\\
For reaping folk \& sowing,\\
For harvest-time \& mowing,\\*
{\vin} A sleepy world of streams.\\!

I am tired of tears and laughter,\\*
{\vin} And men that laugh and weep;\\
Of what may come hereafter\\
{\vin} For men that sow to reap:\\
I am weary of days \& hours,\\
Blown buds of barren flowers,\\
Desires \& dreams \& powers\\*
{\vin} And everything but sleep.\\!

Here life has death for neighbour,\\*
{\vin} And far from eye or ear\\
Wan waves \& wet winds labour,\\
{\vin} Weak ships and spirits steer;\\
They drive adrift, and whither\\
They wot not who make thither;\\
But no such winds blow hither,\\*
{\vin} And no such things grow here.\\!

No growth of moor or coppice,\\*
{\vin} No heather-flower or vine,\\
But bloomless buds of poppies,\\
{\vin} Green grapes of \textit{Proserpine},\\
Pale beds of blowing rushes\\
Where no leaf blooms or blushes\\
Save this whereout she crushes\\*
{\vin} For dead men deadly wine.\\!

Pale, without name or number,\\*
{\vin} In fruitless fields of corn,\\
They bow themselves \& slumber\\
{\vin} All night till light is born;\\
And like a soul belated,\\
In hell \& heaven unmated,\\
By cloud \& mist abated\\*
{\vin} Comes out of darkness morn.\\!

Though one were strong as seven,\\*
{\vin} He too with death shall dwell,\\
Nor wake with wings in heaven,\\
{\vin} Nor weep for pains in hell;\\
Though one were fair as roses,\\
His beauty clouds \& closes;\\
And well though love reposes,\\*
{\vin} In the end it is not well.\\!

Pale, beyond porch \& portal,\\*
{\vin} Crowned with calm leaves, she stands\\
Who gathers all things mortal\\
{\vin} With cold immortal hands;\\
Her languid lips are sweeter\\
Than love's who fears to greet her\\
To men that mix and meet her\\*
{\vin} From many times \& lands.\\!

She waits for each and other,\\*
{\vin} She waits for all men born;\\
Forgets the earth her mother,\\
{\vin} The life of fruits \& corn;\\
And spring \& seed \& swallow\\
Take wing for her and follow\\
Where summer song rings hollow\\*
{\vin} And flowers are put to scorn.\\!

There go the loves that wither,\\*
{\vin} The old loves with wearier wings;\\
And all dead years draw thither,\\
{\vin} And all disastrous things;\\
Dead dreams of days forsaken,\\
Blind buds that snows have shaken,\\
Wild leaves that winds have taken,\\*
{\vin} Red strays of ruined springs.\\!

We are not sure of sorrow,\\*
{\vin} And joy was never sure;\\
To-day will die to-morrow;\\
{\vin} Time stoops to no man's lure;\\
And love, grown faint and fretful,\\
With lips but half regretful\\
Sighs, and with eyes forgetful\\*
{\vin} Weeps that no loves endure.\\!

From too much love of living,\\*
{\vin} From hope and fear set free,\\
We thank with brief thanksgiving\\
{\vin} Whatever gods may be\\
That no life lives for ever;\\
That dead men rise up never;\\
That even the weariest river\\*
{\vin} Winds somewhere safe to sea.\\!

Then star nor sun shall waken,\\*
{\vin} Nor any change of light:\\
Nor sound of waters shaken,\\
{\vin} Nor any sound or sight:\\
Nor wintry leaves nor vernal,\\
Nor days nor things diurnal;\\
Only the sleep eternal\\*
{\vin} In an eternal night.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
In a coign of the cliff between lowland \& highland,\\*\footnotetext{`A Forsaken Garden', Algernon Swinburne (1837 -- 1909), \cite{norton}.}
{\vin} At the sea-down's edge between windward \& lee,\\
Walled round with rocks as an inland island,\\
{\vin} The ghost of a garden fronts the sea.\\
A girdle of brushwood \& thorn encloses\\
{\vin} The steep square slope of the blossomless bed\\
Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses\\*
{\vin} {\vin} {\vin} Now lie dead.\\!

The fields fall southward, abrupt \& broken,\\*
{\vin} To the low last edge of the long lone land.\\
If a step should sound or a word be spoken,\\
{\vin} Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand?\\
So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless,\\
{\vin} Through branches \& briars if a man make way,\\
He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless\\*
{\vin} {\vin} {\vin} Night \& day.\\!

The dense hard passage is blind \& stifled\\*
{\vin} That crawls by a track none turn to climb\\
To the strait waste place that the years have rifled\\
{\vin} Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time.\\
The thorns he spares when the rose is taken;\\
{\vin} The rocks are left when he wastes the plain.\\
The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken,\\*
{\vin} {\vin} {\vin} These remain.\\!

Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not;\\*
{\vin} As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry;\\
From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,\\
{\vin} Could she call, there were never a rose to reply.\\
Over the meadows that blossom \& wither\\
{\vin} Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song;\\
Only the sun \& the rain come hither\\*
{\vin} {\vin} {\vin} All year long.\\!

The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels\\*
{\vin} One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath.\\
Only the wind here hovers \& revels\\
{\vin} In a round where life seems barren as death.\\
Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,\\
{\vin} Haply, of lovers none ever will know,\\
Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping\\*
{\vin} {\vin} {\vin} Years ago.\\!

Heart handfast in heart as they stood, `Look thither,'\\*
{\vin} Did he whisper? 'Look forth from the flowers to the sea;\\
For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither,\\
{\vin} And men that love lightly may die -- but we?'\\
And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened,\\
{\vin} And or ever the garden's last petals were shed,\\
In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened,\\*
{\vin} {\vin} {\vin} Love was dead.\\!

Or they loved their life through, and then went whither?\\*
{\vin} And were one to the end—but what end who knows?\\
Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither,\\
{\vin} As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose.\\
Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them?\\
{\vin} What love was ever as deep as a grave?\\
They are loveless now as the grass above them\\*
{\vin} {\vin} {\vin} Or the wave.\\!

All are at one now, roses \& lovers,\\*
{\vin} Not known of the cliffs \& the fields \& the sea.\\
Not a breath of the time that has been hovers\\
{\vin} In the air now soft with a summer to be.\\
Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter\\
{\vin} Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep,\\
When as they that are free now of weeping \& laughter\\*
{\vin} {\vin} {\vin} We shall sleep.\\!

Here death may deal not again for ever;\\*
{\vin} Here change may come not till all change end.\\
From the graves they have made they shall rise up never,\\
{\vin} Who have left nought living to ravage \& rend.\\
Earth, stones, \& thorns of the wild ground growing,\\
{\vin} While the sun \& the rain live, these shall be;\\
Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing\\*
{\vin} {\vin} {\vin} Roll the sea.\\!

Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,\\*
{\vin} Till terrace \& meadow the deep gulfs drink,\\
Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble\\
{\vin} The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink,\\
Here now in his triumph where all things falter,\\
{\vin} Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread,\\
As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,\\*
{\vin} {\vin} {\vin} Death lies dead.

Like a great ring of pure and endless light,\\
{\vin} All calm, as it was bright;\\
And round beneath it, time in hours, days, years,\\
{\vin} Driven by the spheres\\
Like a vast shadow moved; in which the world\\
{\vin} And all her train were hurled.\\
The doting lover in his quaintest strain\\
{\vin} Did there complain;\\
Near him, his lute, his fancy, and his flights,\\
{\vin} Wit's sour delights,\\
With gloves, and knots, the silly snares of pleasure,\\
{\vin} Yet his dear treasure\\
All scattered lay, while he his eyes did pour\\*
{\vin} Upon a flower.\\!

The darksome statesman hung with weights \& woe,\\*
Like a thick midnight-fog moved there so slow,\\
{\vin} He did not stay, nor go;\\
Condemning thoughts (like sad eclipses) scowl\\
{\vin} Upon his soul,\\
And clouds of crying witnesses without\\
{\vin} Pursued him with one shout.\\
Yet digged the mole, and lest his ways be found,\\
{\vin} Worked under ground,\\
Where he did clutch his prey; but one did see\\
{\vin} That policy;\\
Churches \& altars fed him; perjuries\\
{\vin} Were gnats \& flies;\\
It rained about him blood and tears, but he\\*
{\vin} Drank them as free.\\!

The fearful miser on a heap of rust\\*
Sate pining all his life there, did scarce trust\\
{\vin} His own hands with the dust,\\
Yet would not place one piece above, but lives\\
{\vin} In fear of thieves;\\
Thousands there were as frantic as himself,\\
{\vin} And hugged each one his pelf;\\
The downright epicure placed heaven in sense,\\
{\vin} And scorned pretence,\\
While others, slipped into a wide excess,\\
{\vin} Said little less;\\
The weaker sort slight, trivial wares enslave,\\
{\vin} Who think them brave;\\
And poor despised truth sate counting by\\*
{\vin} Their victory.\\!

Yet some, who all this while did weep and sing,\\*
And sing, and weep, soar'd up into the ring;\\
{\vin} But most would use no wing.\\
O fools (said I) thus to prefer dark night\\
{\vin} Before true light,\\
To live in grots \& caves, and hate the day\\
{\vin} Because it shows the way,\\
The way, which from this dead \& dark abode\\
{\vin} Leads up to God,\\
A way where you might tread the sun, and be\\
{\vin} More bright than he.\\
But as I did their madness so discuss\\
{\vin} One whispered thus,\\
`This ring the Bridegroom did for none provide,\\*
{\vin} But for his bride.'

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree\\*\footnotetext{`After Apple Picking', Robert Frost, Poet Laureate of Vermont (1874 -- 1963), \cite{norton}.}
Toward heaven still,\\
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill\\
Beside it, and there may be two or three\\
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.\\
But I am done with apple-picking now.\\
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,\\
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.\\
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight\\
I got from looking through a pane of glass\\
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough\\
And held against the world of hoary grass.\\
It melted, and I let it fall \& break.\\
But I was well\\
Upon my way to sleep before it fell,\\
And I could tell\\
What form my dreaming was about to take.\\
Magnified apples appear \& disappear,\\
Stem end \& blossom end,\\
And every fleck of russet showing clear.\\
My instep arch not only keeps the ache,\\
It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.\\
I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.\\
And I keep hearing from the cellar bin\\
The rumbling sound\\
Of load on load of apples coming in.\\
For I have had too much\\
Of apple-picking: I am overtired\\
Of the great harvest I myself desired.\\
There were 10,000 thousand fruit to touch,\\
Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.\\
For all\\
That struck the earth,\\
No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,\\
Went surely to the cider-apple heap\\
As of no worth.\\
One can see what will trouble\\
This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.\\
Were he not gone,\\
The woodchuck could say whether it's like his\\
Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,\\*
Or just some human sleep.

Mid hushed, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed,\\

They lay calm-breathing, on the bedded grass;\\

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Let us go then, you \& I,\\*\footnotetext{$\mathbb{R}$ `The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock', Prof Thomas Eliot (1888 -- 1965), \cite{norton}. Prof Eliot begins this poem with a lenghty quotation from Dante, which bears no obvious relation to the text itself -- but that's Eliot.}
When the evening is spread out against the sky\\
Like a patient etherised upon a table;\\
Let us go, through certain \sfrac{$1$}{$2$}-deserted streets,\\
The muttering retreats\\
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels\\
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\\
Streets that follow like a tedious argument\\
Of insidious intent\\
To lead you to an overwhelming question...\\
O do not ask, `What is it?'\\*
Let us go and make our visit.\\!

In the room the women come \& go\\*
Talking of \textit{Michelangelo}.\\!

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,\\*
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,\\
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,\\
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,\\
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\\
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\\
And seeing that it was a soft october night,\\*
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.\\!

And indeed there will be time\\*
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,\\
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;\\
There will be time, there will be time\\
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;\\
There will be time to murder \& create,\\
And time for all the works \& days of hands\\
That lift \& drop a question on your plate;\\
Time for you \& time for me,\\
And time yet for a 100 indecisions,\\
And for a 100 visions \& revisions,\\*
Before the taking of a toast \& tea.\\!

In the room the women come \& go\\*
Talking of \textit{Michelangelo}.\\!

And indeed there will be time\\*
To wonder, `Do I dare?' and, `Do I dare?'\\
Time to turn back and descend the stair,\\
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair --\\
(They will say: `How his hair is growing thin!')\\
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\\
My necktie rich \& modest, but asserted by a simple pin\\
(They will say: `But how his arms \& legs are thin!')\\
Do I dare\\
Disturb the universe?\\
In a minute there is time\\*
For decisions \& revisions which a minute will reverse.\\!

For I have known them all already, known them all:\\*
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\\
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\\
I know the voices dying with a dying fall\\
Beneath the music from a farther room.\\*
So how should I presume?\\!

And I have known the eyes already, known them all --\\*
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\\
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\\
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\\
Then how should I begin\\
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days \& ways?\\*
And how should I presume?\\!

And I have known the arms already, known them all --\\*
Arms that are braceleted \& white \& bare\\
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)\\
Is it perfume from a dress\\
That makes me so digress?\\
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\\
And should I then presume?\\*
And how should I begin?\\!

Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\\*
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\\*
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?...\\!

I should have been a pair of ragged claws\\*
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.\\!

And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\\*
Smoothed by long fingers,\\
Asleep... tired... or it malingers,\\
Stretched on the floor, here beside you \& me.\\
Should I, after tea \& cakes \& ices,\\
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\\
But though I have wept \& fasted, wept \& prayed,\\
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,\\
I am no prophet -- and here's no great matter;\\
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\\
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\\*
And in short, I was afraid.\\!

And would it have been worth it, after all,\\*
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\\
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you \& me,\\
Would it have been worth while,\\
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,\\
To have squeezed the universe into a ball\\
To roll it towards some overwhelming question,\\
To say: `I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\\
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all' --\\
If one, settling a pillow by her head\\
Should say: `That is not what I meant at all;\\*
That is not it, at all.'\\!

And would it have been worth it, after all,\\*
Would it have been worth while,\\
After the sunsets \& the dooryards \& the sprinkled streets,\\
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor --\\
And this, and so much more? --\\
It is impossible to say just what I mean!\\
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\\
Would it have been worth while\\
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,\\
And turning toward the window, should say:\\
`That is not it at all,\\*
That is not what I meant, at all.'\\!

No! I am not Prince \textit{Hamlet}, nor was meant to be;\\*
Am an attendant lord, one that will do\\
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,\\
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\\
Deferential, glad to be of use,\\
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;\\
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\\
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous --\\*
Almost, at times, the fool.\\!

I grow old... I grow old...\\*
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\\!

Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?\\*
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\\*
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.\\!

I do not think that they will sing to me.\\!

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves\\*
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back\\
When the wind blows the water white \& black.\\
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea\\
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red \& brown\\*
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.

\settowidth{\versewidth}{From knoll to knoll, where, couched at ease,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
By night we lingered on the lawn,\\*\footnotetext{Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892), \cite{norton}. This is \textit{In Memoriam A H H} \S 95.}
For underfoot the herb was dry;\\
And genial warmth; and o'er the sky\\*
The silvery haze of summer drawn;\\!

And calm that let the tapers burn\\*
Unwavering: not a cricket chirred:\\
The brook alone far-off was heard,\\*
And on the board the fluttering urn:\\!

And bats went round in fragrant skies,\\*
And wheeled or lit the filmy shapes\\
That haunt the dusk, with ermine capes\\*
And woolly breasts and beaded eyes;\\!

While now we sang old songs that pealed\\*
From knoll to knoll, where, couched at ease,\\
The white kine glimmered, and the trees\\*
Laid their dark arms about the field.\\!

But when those others, one by one,\\*
Withdrew themselves from me and night,\\
And in the house light after light\\*
Went out, and I was all alone,\\!

A hunger seized my heart; I read\\*
Of that glad year which once had been,\\
In those fall'n leaves which kept their green,\\*
The noble letters of the dead:\\!

And strangely on the silence broke\\*
The silent-speaking words, and strange\\
Was love's dumb cry defying change\\*
To test his worth; and strangely spoke\\!

The faith, the vigour, bold to dwell\\*
On doubts that drive the coward back,\\
And keen through wordy snares to track\\*
Suggestion to her inmost cell.\\!

So word by word, and line by line,\\*
The dead man touched me from the past,\\
And all at once it seemed at last\\*
The living soul was flashed on mine,\\!

And mine in this was wound, and whirled\\*
About empyreal heights of thought,\\
And came on that which is, and caught\\*
The deep pulsations of the world,\\!

Aeonian music measuring out\\*
The steps of time, the shocks of chance,\\
The blows of death. At length my trance\\*
Was cancelled, stricken through with doubt.\\!

Vague words! but ah, how hard to frame\\*
In matter-moulded forms of speech,\\
Or ev'n for intellect to reach\\*
Through memory that which I became:\\!

Till now the doubtful dusk revealed\\*
The knolls once more where, couched at ease,\\
The white kine glimmered, and the trees\\*
Laid their dark arms about the field:\\!

And sucked from out the distant gloom\\*
A breeze began to tremble o'er\\
The large leaves of the sycamore,\\*
And fluctuate all the still perfume,\\!

And gathering freshlier overhead,\\*
Rocked the full-foliaged elms, and swung\\
The heavy-folded rose, and flung\\*
The lilies to \& fro, and said,\\!

`The dawn, the dawn,' and died away;\\*
And east and west, without a breath,\\
Mixt their dim lights, like life and death,\\*
To broaden into boundless day.

The vapours weep their burthen to the ground;\\
Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath,\\
And after many a summer dies the swan.\\

Consumes: I wither slowly in thine arms,\\
Here at the quiet limit of the world,\\

The ever-silent spaces of the east,\\*
Far-folded mists, and gleaming halls of morn.\\!

Alas! for this grey shadow, once a man\\*
So glorious in his beauty and thy choice,\\
Who madest him thy chosen, that he seemed\\
To his great heart none other than a god!\\
I asked thee, 'Give me immortality.'\\
Then didst thou grant mine asking with a smile,\\
Like wealthy men, who care not how they give.\\
But thy strong hours indignant worked their wills,\\
And beat me down \& marred \& wasted me,\\
And though they could not end me, left me maimed\\
To dwell in presence of immortal youth,\\
Immortal age beside immortal youth,\\
And all I was, in ashes. Can thy love,\\
Thy beauty, make amends, though even now,\\
Close over us, the silver star, thy guide,\\
Shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with tears\\

Why should a man desire in any way\\
To vary from the kindly race of men\\
Or pass beyond the goal of ordinance\\*
Where all should pause, as is most meet for all?\\!

A soft air fans the cloud apart; there comes\\*
A glimpse of that dark world where I was born.\\
Once more the old mysterious glimmer steals\\
From thy pure brows, and from thy shoulders pure,\\
And bosom beating with a heart renewed.\\
Thy cheek begins to redden through the gloom,\\
Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine,\\
Ere yet they blind the stars, and the wild team\\
Which love thee, yearning for thy yoke, arise,\\
And shake the darkness from their loosened manes,\\*
And beat the twilight into flakes of fire.\\!

Lo! ever thus thou growest beautiful\\*
In silence, then before thine answer given\\*
Departest, and thy tears are on my cheek.\\!

Why wilt thou ever scare me with thy tears,\\*
And make me tremble lest a saying learned,\\
In days far-off, on that dark earth, be true?\\*
'The Gods themselves cannot recall their gifts.'\\!

Ay me! ay me! with what another heart\\*
In days far-off, and with what other eyes\\
I used to watch -- if I be he that watched --\\
The lucid outline forming round thee; saw\\
The dim curls kindle into sunny rings;\\
Changed with thy mystic change, and felt my blood\\
Glow with the glow that slowly crimsoned all\\
Thy presence \& thy portals, while I lay,\\
Mouth, forehead, eyelids, growing dewy-warm\\
With kisses balmier than half-opening buds\\
Of april, and could hear the lips that kissed\\
Whispering I knew not what of wild and sweet,\\
Like that strange song I heard \textit{Apollo} sing,\\*
While \textsc{Ilion} like a mist rose into towers.\\!

Yet hold me not for ever in thine east:\\*
How can my nature longer mix with thine?\\
Coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me, cold\\
Are all thy lights, and cold my wrinkled feet\\
Upon thy glimmering thresholds, when the steam\\
Floats up from those dim fields about the homes\\
Of happy men that have the power to die,\\
And grassy barrows of the happier dead.\\
Release me, and restore me to the ground;\\
Thou seest all things: thou wilt see my grave:\\
Thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn;\\
I earth in earth forget these empty courts,\\*
And thee returning on thy silver wheels.

{\vin} And the white horns tossing above the wall.\\!

There are the beehives ranged in the sun;\\*
{\vin} And down by the brink\\
Of the brook are her poor flowers, weed-o'errun,\\*
{\vin} Pansy and daffodil, rose and pink.\\!

A year has gone, as the tortoise goes,\\*
{\vin} Heavy \& slow;\\
And the same rose blows, and the same sun glows,\\*
{\vin} And the same brook sings of a year ago.\\!

There's the same sweet clover-smell in the breeze;\\*
{\vin} And the june sun warm\\
Tangles his wings of fire in the trees,\\*
{\vin} Setting, as then, over \textsc{Fernside} farm.\\!

I mind me how with a lover's care\\*
{\vin} From my sunday coat\\
I brushed off the burrs, and smoothed my hair,\\*
{\vin} And cooled at the brookside my brow and throat.\\!

Since we parted, a month had passed --\\*
{\vin} To love, a year;\\
Down through the beeches I looked at last\\*
{\vin} On the little red gate and the well-sweep near.\\!

I can see it all now: the slantwise rain\\*
{\vin} Of light through the leaves,\\
The sundown’s blaze on her window-pane,\\*
{\vin} The bloom of her roses under the eaves.\\!

Just the same as a month before,\\*
{\vin} The house and the trees,\\
The barn's brown gable, the vine by the door,\\*
{\vin} Nothing changed but the hives of bees.\\!

Before them, under the garden wall,\\*
{\vin} Forward \& back,\\
Went drearily singing the chore-girl small,\\*
{\vin} Draping each hive with a shred of black.\\!

Trembling, I listened: the summer sun\\*
{\vin} Had the chill of snow;\\
For I knew she was telling the bees of one\\*
{\vin} Gone on the journey we all must go!\\!

Then I said to myself, `My \textit{Mary} weeps\\*
{\vin} For the dead today:\\
Haply her blind old grandsire sleeps\\*
{\vin} The fret and the pain of his age away.'\\!

But her dog whined low; on the doorway sill,\\*
{\vin} With his cane to his chin,\\
The old man sat; and the chore-girl still\\*
{\vin} Sung to the bees stealing out and in.\\!

And the song she was singing ever since\\*
{\vin} In my ear sounds on:\\
`Stay at home, pretty bees; fly not hence!\\*
{\vin} Mistress \textit{Mary} is dead \& gone!'

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
But do not let us quarrel any more,\\*\footnotetext{`Andrea del Sarto', Robert Browning (1828 -- 1889), \cite{norton}. Subtitle: `Called ``The Faultless Painter{''}'. Andrea del Sarto was an artist of the Italian Renaissance. He was thought to be one of the best painters in the world in his own time, but his reputation has fared less well than those of his contemporaries Michelangelo, da Vinci and Raphael. \P 12. Fiesole is a small town overlooking Florence.}
No, my \textit{Lucrezia}; bear with me for once:\\
Sit down and all shall happen as you wish.\\
You turn your face, but does it bring your heart?\\
I'll work then for your friend's friend, never fear,\\
Treat his own subject after his own way,\\
Fix his own time, accept too his own price,\\
And shut the money into this small hand\\
When next it takes mine. Will it? tenderly?\\
O I'll content him, but tomorrow, love!\\
I often am much wearier than you think,\\
This evening more than usual, and it seems\\
As if -- forgive now -- should you let me sit\\
Here by the window with your hand in mine\\
And look a \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} hour forth on \textsc{Fiesole},\\
Both of one mind, as married people use,\\
Quietly, quietly the evening through,\\
I might get up to-morrow to my work\\
Cheerful \& fresh as ever. Let us try.\\
Tomorrow, how you shall be glad for this!\\
Your soft hand is a woman of itself,\\
And mine the man's bared breast she curls inside.\\
Don't count the time lost, neither; you must serve\\
For each of the five pictures we require:\\
It saves a model. So! keep looking so --\\
My serpentining beauty, rounds on rounds!\\
How could you ever prick those perfect ears\\
Even to put the pearl there?! O so sweet --\\
My face, my moon, my everybody's moon,\\
Which everybody looks on and calls his,\\
And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn,\\
While she looks -- no one's: very dear, no less.\\
You smile? Why, there's my picture ready made,\\
There's what we painters call our harmony!\\
A common greyness silvers everything,\\
All in a twilight, you \& I alike\\
You, at the point of your first pride in me\\
(That's gone you know), but I, at every point;\\
My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down\\
To yonder sober pleasant \textsc{Fiesole}.\\
There's the bell clinking from the chapel-top;\\
That length of convent-wall across the way\\
Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside;\\
The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease,\\
And autumn grows, autumn in everything.\\
Eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape\\
As if I saw alike my work and self\\
And all that I was born to be \& do,\\
A twilight-piece. Love, we are in God's hand.\\
How strange now, looks the life he makes us lead;\\
So free we seem, so fettered fast we are!\\
I feel he laid the fetter: let it lie!\\
This chamber for example -- turn your head --\\
All that's behind us! You don't understand\\
Nor care to understand about my art,\\
But you can hear at least when people speak:\\
And that cartoon, the second from the door\\
-- It is the thing, love! so such things should be --\\
Behold Madonna! I am bold to say.\\
I can do with my pencil what I know,\\
What I see, what at bottom of my heart\\
I wish for, if I ever wish so deep --\\
Do easily, too -- when I say, perfectly,\\
I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge,\\
Who listened to the legate's talk last week,\\
And just as much they used to say in France.\\
At any rate 'tis easy, all of it!\\
No sketches first, no studies, that's long past:\\
I do what many dream of, all their lives,\\
Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do,\\
And fail in doing. I could count twenty such\\
On twice your fingers, and not leave this town,\\
Who strive -- you don't know how the others strive\\
To paint a little thing like that you smeared\\
Carelessly passing with your robes afloat --\\
Yet do much less, so much less, someone says,\\
(I know his name, no matter) -- so much less!\\
Well, less is more, \textit{Lucrezia}: I am judged.\\
There burns a truer light of God in them,\\
In their vexed beating stuffed \& stopped-up brain,\\
Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt\\
This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine.\\
Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know,\\
Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me,\\
Enter and take their place there sure enough,\\
Though they come back and cannot tell the world.\\
My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here.\\
The sudden blood of these men! at a word --\\
Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too.\\
I, painting from myself and to myself,\\
Know what I do, am unmoved by men's blame\\
Or their praise either. Somebody remarks\\
\textit{Morello}'s outline there is wrongly traced,\\
His hue mistaken; what of that? or else,\\
Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that?\\
Speak as they please, what does the mountain care?\\
Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp,\\
Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-grey,\\
Placid \& perfect with my art: the worse!\\
I know both what I want and what might gain,\\
And yet how profitless to know, to sigh,\\
`Had I been two, another and myself,\\
Our head would have o'erlooked the world!' No doubt.\\
Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth\\
The urbinate who died five years ago.\\
('Tis copied, \textit{George Vasari} sent it me.)\\
Well, I can fancy how he did it all,\\
Pouring his soul, with kings \& popes to see,\\
Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him,\\
Above and through his art -- for it gives way;\\
That arm is wrongly put -- and there again --\\
A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines,\\
Its body, so to speak: its soul is right,\\
He means right -- that, a child may understand.\\
Still, what an arm! and I could alter it:\\
But all the play, the insight and the stretch --\\
(Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out?\\
Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul,\\
We might have risen to \textit{Rafael}, I \& you!\\
Nay, love, you did give all I asked, I think --\\
More than I merit, yes, by many times.\\
But had you -- O with the same perfect brow,\\
And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth,\\
And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird\\
The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare --\\
Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind!\\
Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged,\\
`God and the glory! never care for gain.\\
The present by the future, what is that?\\
Live for fame, side by side with \textit{Agnolo}!\\
\textit{Rafael} is waiting: up to God, all three!'\\
I might have done it for you. So it seems:\\
Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules.\\
Beside, incentives come from the soul's self;\\
The rest avail not. Why do I need you?\\
What wife had \textit{Rafael}, or has \textit{Agnolo}?\\
In this world, who can do a thing, will not;\\
And who would do it, cannot, I perceive:\\
Yet the will's somewhat -- somewhat, too, the power --\\
And thus we \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} men struggle. At the end,\\
God, I conclude, compensates, punishes.\\
'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict,\\
That I am something underrated here,\\
Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth.\\
I dared not, do you know, leave home all day,\\
For fear of chancing on the \textsc{Paris} lords.\\
The best is when they pass \& look aside;\\
But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all.\\
Well may they speak! That \textit{Francis}, that first time,\\
And that long festal year at \textsc{Fontainebleau}!\\
I surely then could sometimes leave the ground,\\
Put on the glory, \textit{Rafael}'s daily wear,\\
In that humane great monarch's golden look --\\
One finger in his beard or twisted curl\\
Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile,\\
One arm about my shoulder, round my neck,\\
The jingle of his gold chain in my ear,\\
I painting proudly with his breath on me,\\
All his court round him, seeing with his eyes,\\
Such frank french eyes, and such a fire of souls\\
Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts --\\
And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond,\\
This in the background, waiting on my work,\\
To crown the issue with a last reward!\\
A good time, was it not, my kingly days?\\
And had you not grown restless... but I know --\\
'Tis done \& past: 'twas right, my instinct said:\\
Too live the life grew, golden and not grey,\\
And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt\\
Out of the grange whose four walls make his world.\\
How could it end in any other way?\\
You called me, and I came home to your heart.\\
The triumph was -- to reach and stay there; since\\
I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost?\\
Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold,\\
You beautiful \textit{Lucrezia} that are mine!\\
`\textit{Rafael} did this, \textit{Andrea} painted that;\\
The roman's is the better when you pray,\\
But still the other's Virgin was his wife' --\\
Men will excuse me. I am glad to judge\\
Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows\\
My better fortune, I resolve to think.\\
For, do you know, \textit{Lucrezia}, as God lives,\\
Said one day \textit{Agnolo}, his very self,\\
To \textit{Rafael}... I have known it all these years...\\
(When the young man was flaming out his thoughts\\
Upon a palace-wall for \textsc{Rome} to see,\\
Too lifted up in heart because of it.)\\
`Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub\\
Goes up \& down our \textsc{Florence}, none cares how,\\
Who, were he set to plan \& execute\\
As you are, pricked on by your popes \& kings,\\
Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!'\\
To \textit{Rafael}'s! And indeed the arm is wrong.\\
I hardly dare... Yet, only you to see,\\
Give the chalk here -- quick, thus, the line should go!\\
Aye, but the soul! he's \textit{Rafael}! Rub it out!\\
Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth,\\
(What he? why, who but \textit{Michel Agnolo}?\\
Do you forget already words like those?)\\
If really there was such a chance, so lost --\\
Is, whether you're -- not grateful -- but more pleased.\\
Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed!\\
This hour has been an hour! Another smile?\\
If you would sit thus by me every night\\
I should work better, do you comprehend?\\
I mean that I should earn more, give you more.\\
See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star;\\
\textit{Morello}'s gone, the watch-lights show the wall,\\
The cue-owls speak the name we call them by.\\
Come from the window, love; come in, at last,\\
Inside the melancholy little house\\
We built to be so gay with. God is just.\\
King \textit{Francis} may forgive me: oft at nights\\
When I look up from painting, eyes tired out,\\
The walls become illumined, brick from brick\\
Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold,\\
That gold of his I did cement them with!\\
Let us but love each other. Must you go?\\
That cousin here again? He waits outside?\\
Must see you? You, and not with me? Those loans?\\
More gaming debts to pay? You smiled for that?\\
Well, let smiles buy me! Have you more to spend?\\
While hand \& eye \& something of a heart\\
Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth?\\
I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit\\
The grey remainder of the evening out,\\
Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly\\
How I could paint, were I but back in France,\\
One picture, just one more -- the Virgin's face,\\
Not yours this time! I want you at my side\\
To hear them -- that is, \textit{Michel Agnolo} --\\
Judge all I do and tell you of its worth.\\
Will you? Tomorrow, satisfy your friend.\\
I take the subjects for his corridor,\\
Finish the portrait out of hand -- there, there,\\
And throw him in another thing or two\\
If he demurs; the whole should prove enough\\
To pay for this same cousin's freak. Beside,\\
What's better and what's all I care about,\\
Get you the 13 {\hoskeroe scudi} for the ruff!\\
Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he,\\*
The cousin? What does he to please you more?\\!

I am grown peaceful as old age tonight.\\*
I regret little; I would change still less.\\
Since there my past life lies, why alter it?\\
The very wrong to \textit{Francis}! It is true\\
I took his coin, was tempted and complied,\\
And built this house and sinned, and all is said.\\
My father \& my mother died of want.\\
Well, had I riches of my own? You see\\
How one gets rich! Let each one bear his lot.\\
They were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died:\\
And I have laboured somewhat in my time\\
And not been paid profusely. Some good son\\
Paint my 200 pictures -- let him try!\\
No doubt, there's something strikes a balance. Yes,\\
You loved me quite enough. it seems to-night.\\
This must suffice me here. What would one have?\\
In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance --\\
Four great walls in the \textsc{New Jerusalem},\\
Meted on each side by the angel's reed,\\
For \textit{Leonard}, \textit{Rafael}, \textit{Agnolo} and me\\
To cover -- the three first without a wife,\\
While I have mine! So -- still they overcome\\*
Because there's still \textit{Lucrezia}, as I choose.\\!

Again the cousin's whistle! Go, my love.

My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk.  When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even in seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and slates jutted off here \& there, beyond the right line of the roof, to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.\\!\footnotetext{Miss Emily Brontë (1818 -- 1848), \cite{wuthering}.}

I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the moor: the middle one grey, and \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} buried in the heath; \textit{Edgar Linton}'s only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; \textit{Heathcliff}'s still bare.\\!

I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath \& harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.

As the team's head-brass flashed out on the turn\\*\footnotetext{Edward Thomas (1878 -- 1917), \cite{norton}.}
The lovers disappeared into the wood.\\
I sat among the boughs of the fallen elm\\
That strewed an angle of the fallow, and\\
Watched the plough narrowing a yellow square\\
Of charlock. Every time the horses turned\\
Instead of treading me down, the ploughman leaned\\
Upon the handles to say or ask a word,\\
About the weather, next about the war.\\
Scraping the share he faced towards the wood,\\
And screwed along the furrow till the brass flashed\\
Once more. The blizzard felled the elm whose crest\\
I sat in, by a woodpecker's round hole,\\
The ploughman said. `When will they take it away?'\\
`When the war's over.' So the talk began --\\
One minute \& an interval of 10,\\
A minute more \& the same interval.\\
`Have you been out?' `No.' `And don’t want to, perhaps?'\\
`If I could only come back again, I should.\\
I could spare an arm. I shouldn't want to lose\\
A leg. If I should lose my head, why, so,\\
I should want nothing more... Have many gone\\
From here?' `Yes.' `Many lost?' `Yes, a good few.\\
Only two teams work on the farm this year.\\
One of my mates is dead. The second day\\
In France they killed him. It was back in march,\\
The very night of the blizzard, too. Now if\\
He had stayed here we should have moved the tree.'\\
`And I should not have sat here. Everything\\
Would have been different. For it would have been\\
Another world.' `Ay, \& a better, though,\\
If we could see all, all might seem good.' Then\\
The lovers came out of the wood again:\\
The horses started and for the last time\\
I watched the clods crumble \& topple over\\*
After the ploughshare and the stumbling team.

Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul;\\

For in death no man remembereth thee,\\
{\vin} And who will give thee thanks in the pit?\\
I am weary of my groaning; every night I wash my bed,\\

My beauty is gone for very trouble,\\

Away from me, all ye that work vanity,\\

They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the peoples, and their Lord shall reign for ever.

Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?\\*
{\vin} Gird up now thy loins like a man;\\
For I will demand of thee,\\*
{\vin} And answer thou me.\\!

Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?\\*

Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest?\\
{\vin} Or who hath stretched the line upon it?\\
Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?\\
{\vin} Or who laid the corner stone thereof;\\
When the morning stars sang together,\\*
{\vin} And all the sons of God shouted for joy?\\!

Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth,\\*
{\vin} As if it had issued out of the womb?\\
When I made the cloud the garment thereof,\\
{\vin} And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,\\
And brake up for it my decreed place,\\
{\vin} And set bars and doors,\\
And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further:\\*
{\vin} And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?\\!

Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;\\*
{\vin} And caused the dayspring to know his place;\\
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,\\
{\vin} That the wicked might be shaken out of it?\\
It is turned as clay to the seal;\\
{\vin} And they stand as a garment.\\
And from the wicked their light is withholden,\\*
{\vin} And the high arm shall be broken.\\!

Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?\\*
{\vin} Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?\\
Have the gates of death been opened unto thee?\\*
{\vin} Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?\\!

Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?\\*
{\vin} Declare if thou knowest it all.\\
Where is the way where light dwelleth?\\
{\vin} And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,\\
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,\\
{\vin} And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?\\
Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born?\\*
{\vin} Or because the number of thy days is great?\\!

Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?\\*
{\vin} Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,\\
Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,\\*
{\vin} Against the day of battle and war?\\!

By what way is the light parted,\\*
{\vin} Which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?\\
Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,\\
{\vin} Or a way for the lightning of thunder;\\
To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is;\\
{\vin} On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;\\
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground;\\
{\vin} And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?\\
Hath the rain a father?\\
{\vin} Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?\\
Out of whose womb came the ice?\\*
{\vin} And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?\\!

The waters are hid as with a stone,\\*
{\vin} And the face of the deep is frozen.\\
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades,\\

Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?\\*

Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven?\\*

Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,\\

Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go,\\*

Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?\\*
{\vin} Or fill the appetite of the young lions,\\
When they couch in their dens,\\
{\vin} And abide in the covert to lie in wait?\\
Who provideth for the raven his food?\\*
{\vin} When his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.\\!

Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?\\*
{\vin} Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?\\
Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?\\
{\vin} Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?\\
They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones,\\
{\vin} they cast out their sorrows.\\
Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;\\*
{\vin} They go forth, and return not unto them.\\!

Who hath sent out the wild ass free?\\*
{\vin} Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?\\
Whose house I have made the wilderness,\\
{\vin} And the barren land his dwellings.\\
He scorneth the multitude of the city,\\
{\vin} Neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.\\
The range of the mountains is his pasture,\\*
{\vin} And he searcheth after every green thing.\\!

Will the ox be willing to serve thee,\\*

Canst thou bind the ox with his band in the furrow?\\

Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?\\

Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed,\\*
{\vin} And gather it into thy barn?\\!

Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?\\*
{\vin} Or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?\\
Which leaveth her eggs in the earth,\\
{\vin} And warmeth them in dust,\\
And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,\\
{\vin} Or that the wild beast may break them.\\
She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers:\\
{\vin} Her labour is in vain without fear;\\
Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,\\
{\vin} Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.\\

{\vin} She scorneth the horse and his rider.\\!

Hast thou given the horse strength?\\*
{\vin} Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?\\
Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper?\\
{\vin} The glory of his nostrils is terrible.\\
He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:\\
{\vin} He goeth on to meet the armed men.\\
He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted;\\
{\vin} Neither turneth he back from the sword.\\
The quiver rattleth against him,\\
{\vin} The glittering spear and the shield.\\
He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage:\\
{\vin} Neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.\\
He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha;\\
{\vin} And he smelleth the battle afar off,\\
The thunder of the captains,\\*
{\vin} And the shouting.\\!

Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom,\\*
{\vin} And stretch her wings toward the south?\\
Doth the eagle mount up at thy command,\\
{\vin} And make her nest on high?\\
She dwelleth and abideth on the rock,\\
{\vin} Upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.\\
From thence she seeketh the prey,\\
{\vin} And her eyes behold afar off.\\
Her young ones also suck up blood:\\*
{\vin} And where the slain are, there is she.\\!

Moreover, the {\hoskeroe LORD} answered \textit{Job}, and said,\\!

Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him?\\*
{\vin} He that reproveth God, let him answer it.\\!

Then \textit{Job} answered the {\hoskeroe LORD}, and said,\\!

Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee?\\*
{\vin} I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.\\
Once have I spoken; but I will not answer:\\*
{\vin} Yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.\\!

Then answered the {\hoskeroe LORD} unto \textit{Job} out of the whirlwind, and said,\\!

Gird up thy loins now\\*
{\vin} Like a man:\\
I will demand of thee,\\*
{\vin} And declare thou unto me.\\!

Wilt thou also disannul my judgment?\\*
{\vin} Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?\\
Hast thou an arm like God?\\
{\vin} Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?\\
Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency;\\
{\vin} And array thyself with glory and beauty.\\
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath:\\
{\vin} And behold every one that is proud, and abase him.\\
Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low;\\
{\vin} And tread down the wicked in their place.\\
Hide them in the dust together;\\
{\vin} And bind their faces in secret.\\
Then will I also confess unto thee\\*
{\vin} That thine own right hand can save thee.\\!

Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee;\\*
{\vin} He eateth grass as an ox.\\
Lo now, his strength is in his loins,\\
{\vin} And his force is in the navel of his belly.\\
He moveth his tail like a cedar:\\
{\vin} The sinews of his stones are wrapped together.\\
His bones are as strong pieces of brass;\\
{\vin} His bones are like bars of iron.\\
He is the chief of the ways of God:\\
{\vin} He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.\\
Surely the mountains bring him forth food,\\
{\vin} Where all the beasts of the field play.\\
He lieth under the shady trees,\\
{\vin} In the covert of the reed, and fens.\\
The shady trees cover him with their shadow;\\
{\vin} The willows of the brook compass him about.\\
Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not:\\
{\vin} He trusteth that he can draw up \textsc{Jordan} into his mouth.\\
He taketh it with his eyes:\\*
{\vin} His nose pierceth through snares.\\!

Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?\\*
{\vin} Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?\\
Canst thou put an hook into his nose?\\
{\vin} Or bore his jaw through with a thorn?\\
Will he make many supplications unto thee?\\
{\vin} Will he speak soft words unto thee?\\
Will he make a covenant with thee?\\
{\vin} Wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?\\
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?\\
{\vin} Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?\\
Shall the companions make a banquet of him?\\
{\vin} Shall they part him among the merchants?\\
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?\\
{\vin} Or his head with fish spears?\\
Lay thine hand upon him,\\
{\vin} Remember the battle, do no more.\\
Behold, the hope of him is in vain:\\
{\vin} Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?\\
None is so fierce that dare stir him up:\\
{\vin} Who then is able to stand before me?\\
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?\\
{\vin} Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.\\
I will not conceal his parts, nor his power,\\
{\vin} Nor his comely proportion.\\
Who can discover the face of his garment?\\
{\vin} Or who can come to him with his double bridle?\\
Who can open the doors of his face?\\
{\vin} His teeth are terrible round about.\\
His scales are his pride,\\
{\vin} Shut up together as with a close seal.\\
One is so near to another,\\
{\vin} That no air can come between them.\\
They are joined one to another,\\
{\vin} They stick together, that they cannot be sundered.\\
By his neesings a light doth shine,\\
{\vin} And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.\\
Out of his mouth go burning lamps,\\
{\vin} And sparks of fire leap out.\\
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke,\\
{\vin} As out of a seething pot or caldron.\\
His breath kindleth coals,\\
{\vin} And a flame goeth out of his mouth.\\
In his neck remaineth strength,\\
{\vin} And sorrow is turned into joy before him.\\
The flakes of his flesh are joined together:\\
{\vin} They are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.\\
His heart is as firm as a stone;\\
{\vin} Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.\\
When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid:\\
{\vin} By reason of breakings they purify themselves.\\
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold:\\
{\vin} The spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.\\
He esteemeth iron as straw,\\
{\vin} And brass as rotten wood.\\
The arrow cannot make him flee:\\
{\vin} Slingstones are turned with him into stubble.\\
Darts are counted as stubble:\\
{\vin} He laugheth at the shaking of a spear.\\
Sharp stones are under him:\\
{\vin} He spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.\\
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:\\
{\vin} He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.\\
He maketh a path to shine after him;\\
{\vin} One would think the deep to be hoary.\\
Upon earth there is not his like,\\
{\vin} Who is made without fear.\\
He beholdeth all high things:\\*
{\vin} He is a king over all the children of pride.\\!

Then \textit{Job} answered the {\hoskeroe LORD}, and said,\\!

I know that thou canst do every thing,\\*
{\vin} And that no thought can be withholden from thee.\\
Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge?\\
{\vin} Therefore have I uttered that I understood not;\\
Things too wonderful for me,\\
{\vin} Which I knew not.\\
Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak:\\
{\vin} I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.\\
I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear:\\
{\vin} But now mine eye seeth thee.\\
Wherefore I abhor myself,\\*
{\vin} And repent in dust and ashes.

And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing.\\
Love suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,\\
Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;\\
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;\\
Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.\\
Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.\\
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.\\
But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\\
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.\\
For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.\\*
And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.\\
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.\\
Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.\\
But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\\
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the {\hoskeroe LORD} hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.\\
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.\\
He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.\\
And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.\\
Yet it pleased the {\hoskeroe LORD} to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the {\hoskeroe LORD} shall prosper in his hand.\\
He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.\\*
Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

And I will come near to you to judgement; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the {\hoskeroe LORD} of hosts.\\
For I am the {\hoskeroe LORD}, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.\\
Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the {\hoskeroe LORD} of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?\\
Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes \& offerings.\\
Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.\\
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the {\hoskeroe LORD} of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\\
And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the {\hoskeroe LORD} of hosts.\\*
And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the {\hoskeroe LORD} of hosts.\\!

Your words have been stout against me, saith the {\hoskeroe LORD}. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?\\*
Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the {\hoskeroe LORD} of hosts?\\
And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.\\
Then they that feared the {\hoskeroe LORD} spake often one to another: and the {\hoskeroe LORD} hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the {\hoskeroe LORD}, and that thought upon his name.\\
And they shall be mine, saith the {\hoskeroe LORD} of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.\\*
Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.\\!

For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the {\hoskeroe LORD} of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.\\*
But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.\\*
And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the {\hoskeroe LORD} of hosts.\\!

Remember ye the law of \textit{Moses} my servant, which I commanded unto him in \textsc{Horeb} for all Israel, with the statutes \&\\*
judgments.\\
Behold, I will send you \textit{Elijah} the prophet before the coming of the great \& dreadful day of the {\hoskeroe LORD}:\\*
And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.

And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.\\*\footnotetext{Revelation 21,22.1-5, \cite{kjv}.}
And I \textit{John} saw the holy city, \textsc{New Jerusalem}, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.\\
And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.\\
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\\
And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.\\
And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.\\
He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.\\
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\\
And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.\\
And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy \textsc{Jerusalem}, descending out of heaven from God,\\
Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;\\
And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:\\
On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.\\
And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.\\
And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.\\
And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.\\
And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.\\
And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.\\
And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;\\
The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.\\
And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.\\
And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.\\
And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.\\
And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.\\
And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.\\
And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.\\
And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.\\
And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.\\
In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\\
And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:\\
And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.\\*
And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.\\
Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:\\
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.\\
As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.\\
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\\

Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak\\
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.\\
Yet not to thine eternal resting-place\\
Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish\\
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down\\
With patriarchs of the infant world, with kings,\\
The powerful of the earth, the wise, the good,\\
Fair forms, \& hoary seers of ages past,\\
All in one mighty sepulchre.   The hills\\
Rock-ribbed \& ancient as the sun, the vales\\
Stretching in pensive quietness between;\\
The venerable woods -- rivers that move\\
In majesty, and the complaining brooks\\
That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,\\
Old ocean's grey \& melancholy waste,\\
Are but the solemn decorations all\\
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,\\
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,\\
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,\\
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread\\
The globe are but a handful to the tribes\\
That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings\\
Of morning, pierce the barcan wilderness,\\
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods\\
Where rolls the \textsc{Oregon}, and hears no sound,\\
Save his own dashings -- yet the dead are there:\\
And 1,000,000s in those solitudes, since first\\
The flight of years began, have laid them down\\
In their last sleep—the dead reign there alone.\\
So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw\\
In silence from the living, and no friend\\
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe\\
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh\\
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care\\
Plod on, and each one as before will chase\\
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave\\
Their mirth \& their employments, and shall come\\
And make their bed with thee. As the long train\\
Of ages glide away, the sons of men,\\
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes\\
In the full strength of years, matron \& maid,\\
The speechless babe, and the grey-headed man\\
Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,\\
By those, who in their turn shall follow them.\\
So live, that when thy summons comes to join\\
The innumerable caravan, which moves\\
To that mysterious realm, where each shall take\\
His chamber in the silent halls of death,\\
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,\\
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained \& soothed\\
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,\\
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch\\*
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Just when our drawing-rooms begin to blaze\\*\footnotetext{William Cowper (1731 -- 1800), \cite{norton}. This is an excerpt from a long poem, \textit{The Task}, a series of urbane reflections.}
With lights by clear reflection multiplied\\
From many a mirror (in which he of \textsc{Gath},\\
\textit{Goliath}, might have seen his giant bulk\\
Whole without stooping, tow'ring crest \& all),\\
My pleasures too begin. But me perhaps\\
The glowing hearth may satisfy awhile\\
With faint illumination that uplifts\\
The shadow to the ceiling, there by fits\\
Dancing uncouthly to the quiv'ring flame.\\
Not undelightful is an hour to me\\
So spent in parlour twilight; such a gloom\\
Suits well the thoughtful or unthinking mind,\\
The mind contemplative, with some new theme\\
Pregnant, or indisposed alike to all.\\
Laugh ye, who boast your more mercurial pow'rs\\
That never feel a stupor, know no pause\\
Nor need one. I am conscious, and confess\\
Fearless, a soul that does not always think.\\
Me oft has fancy ludicrous \& wild\\
Soothed with a waking dream of houses, tow'rs,\\
Trees, churches, \& strange visages expressed\\
In the red cinders, while with poring eye\\
I gazed, myself creating what I saw.\\
Nor less amused have I quiescent watched\\
The sooty films that play upon the bars --\\
Pendulous, \& foreboding in the view\\
Of superstition, prophesying still,\\
Though still deceived, some stranger's near approach.\\
'Tis thus the understanding takes repose\\
In indolent vacuity of thought,\\
And sleeps \& is refrshed. Meanwhile the face\\
Conceals the mood lethargic with a mask\\
Of deep deliberation, as the man\\
Were tasked to his full strength, absorbed \& lost.\\
Thus oft reclined at ease, I lose an hour\\
At evening, till at length the freezing blast\\
That sweeps the bolted shutter, summons home\\
The recollected powers and, snapping short\\
The glassy threads with which the fancy weaves\\
Her brittle toys, restores me to myself.\\
How calm is my recess, and how the frost\\
Raging abroad, and the rough wind, endear\\
The silence \& the warmth enjoyed within.\\
I saw the woods \& fields at close of day,\\
A variegated show; the meadows green\\
Though faded, and the lands where lately waved\\
The golden harvest, of a mellow brown,\\
Upturned so lately by the forceful share.\\
I saw far off the weedy fallows smile\\
With verdure not unprofitable, grazed\\
By flocks fast-feeding \& selecting each\\
His fav'rite herb; while all the leafless groves\\
That skirt th'horizon wore a sable hue\\
Scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve.\\
Tomorrow brings a change, a total change\\
Which even now -- though silently performed\\
And slowly, and by most unfelt -- the face\\
Of universal nature undergoes.\\
Fast falls a fleecy show'r. The downy flakes\\
Descending, and with never-ceasing lapse\\
Softly alighting upon all below,\\
Assimilate all objects. Earth receives\\
Gladly the thick'ning mantle, \& the green\\
And tender blade that feared the chilling blast\\*
Escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil.

\settowidth{\versewidth}{One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Out walking in the frozen swamp one grey day,\\*\footnotetext{`The Wood-Pile', Robert Frost, Poet Laureate of Vermont (1874 -- 1963), \cite{norton}.}
I paused and said, `I will turn back from here.\\
No, I will go on farther -- and we shall see.'\\
The hard snow held me, save where now \& then\\
One foot went through. The view was all in lines\\
Straight up \& down of tall slim trees\\
Too much alike to mark or name a place by\\
So as to say for certain I was here\\
Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.\\
A small bird flew before me. He was careful\\
To put a tree between us when he lighted,\\
And say no word to tell me who he was\\
Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.\\
He thought that I was after him for a feather --\\
The white one in his tail; like one who takes\\
Everything said as personal to himself.\\
One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.\\
And then there was a pile of wood for which\\
I forgot him and let his little fear\\
Carry him off the way I might have gone,\\
Without so much as wishing him good night.\\
He went behind it to make his last stand.\\
It was a cord of maple, cut \& split\\
And piled -- and measured, four by four by eight.\\
And not another like it could I see.\\
No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.\\
And it was older sure than this year's cutting,\\
Or even last year's or the year's before.\\
The wood was grey \& the bark warping off it\\
And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis\\
Had wound strings round \& round it like a bundle.\\
What held it though on one side was a tree\\
Still growing, and on one a stake \& prop,\\
These latter about to fall. I thought that only\\
Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks\\
Could so forget his handiwork on which\\
He spent himself, the labor of his axe,\\
And leave it there far from a useful fireplace\\
To warm the frozen swamp as best it could\\*
With the slow smokeless burning of decay.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
'Twas going to snow. 'Twas snowing. Curse his luck.\\*\footnotetext{`The Drove-Road', Wilfrid Gibson (1878 -- 1962), \cite{oxfordlarkin}. \P 23. The term `Irish Channel' is an archaic name for the North Channel which connects the Irish Sea with the Atlantic.}
And 15 mile to travel. Here was he\\
With nothing but an empty pipe to suck,\\
And \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} a flask of rum -- but that would be\\
More welcome later on. He'd had a drink\\
Before he left, and that would keep him warm\\
A tidy while; and 'twould be good to think\\
He'd something to fall back on if the storm\\
Should come to much. You never knew with snow.\\
A sup of rain he didn't mind at all,\\
But snow was different with so far to go --\\
Full 15 mile, and not a house of call.\\
Ay, snow was quite another story, quite --\\
Snow on the fell-tops with a north-east wind\\
Behind it, blowing steadily with a bite\\
That made you feel that you were stark \& skinned.\\
And those poor beasts -- and they just off the boat\\
A day or so, and hardly used to land --\\
Still dizzy with the sea, their wits afloat.\\
When they first reached the dock they scarce could stand,\\
They'd been so joggled. It's gey bad to cross,\\
After a long day's jolting in the train,\\
Thon Irish Channel, always pitch \& toss --\\
And, heads or tails, not much for them to gain.\\
And then the market, and the throng \& noise\\
Of yapping dogs; and they stung mad with fear,\\
Welted with switches by those senseless boys --\\
He'd like to dust their jackets. But 'twas queer,\\
A beast's life, when you came to think of it,\\
From start to finish -- queerer, ay, a lot\\
Than any man's, and chancier a good bit.\\
With his ash-sapling at their heels they'd got\\
To travel before night those 15 miles\\
Of hard fell road against the driving snow,\\
Half-blinded, on \& on. He thought at whiles\\
'Twas just as well for them they couldn't know...\\
Though, as for that, 'twas little that he knew\\
Himself what was in store for him. He took\\
Things as they came: 'twas all a man could do;\\
And he'd kept going somehow by hook or crook.\\
And here he was, with 15 mile of fell,\\
And snow and... God, but it was blowing stiff.\\
And no tobacco. Blessed if he could tell\\
Where he had lost it -- but for \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} a whiff\\
He'd swop the very jacket off his back --\\
Not that he'd miss the cobweb of old shreds\\
That held the holes together. Thon cheap-jack\\
Who'd sold it him had said it was Lord \textit{Ted}'s,\\
And london-cut: but \textit{Teddy} had grown fat\\
Since he'd been made an alderman... His bid?\\
And did the gentleman not want a hat\\
To go with it, a topper? If he did,\\
Here was the very... Hell, but it was cold,\\
And driving dark it was -- nigh dark as night.\\
He'd almost think he must be getting old\\
To feel the wind so. And long out of sight\\
The beasts had trotted. Well, what odds. The way\\
Ran straight for 10 miles on, and they'd go straight:\\
They'd never heed a by-road. Many a day\\
He'd had to trudge on, trusting them to fate,\\
And always found them safe. They scamper fast,\\
But in the end a man could walk them down:\\
They're showy trotters, but they cannot last:\\
He'd race the fastest beast for half-a-crown\\
On a day's journey. Beasts were never made\\
For steady travelling -- drive them 20 mile\\
And they were done; while he was not afraid\\
To travel twice that distance with a smile.\\
But not a day like this. He'd never felt\\
A wind with such an edge. 'Twas like the blade\\
Of the rasper in the pocket of his belt\\
He kept for easy shaving. In his trade\\
You'd oft to make your toilet under a dyke --\\
And he was always one for a clean chin,\\
And carried soap. He'd never felt the like --\\
That wind, it cut clean through you to the skin.\\
He might be mother-naked, walking bare,\\
For all the use his clothes were, with the snow\\
Half blinding him and clagging to his hair\\
And trickling down his spine. He'd like to know\\
What was the sense of pegging steadily,\\
Chilled to the marrow, after a daft herd\\
Of draggled beasts he couldn't even see.\\
But that was him all over -- just a word,\\
A nod, a wink, the price of \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} \& \sfrac{$1$}{$2$},\\
And he'd be setting out for God-knows-where\\
With no more notion than a yearling calf\\
Where he would find himself when he got there.\\
And he'd been travelling hard on 60 year\\
The same old road, the same old giddy gait;\\
And he'd be walking, for a pint of beer,\\
Into his coffin one day, soon or late --\\
But not with such a tempest in his teeth,\\
Half-blinded and \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} dothered, that he hoped.\\
He'd met a sight of weather on the heath,\\
But this beat all. 'Twas worse than when he'd groped\\
His way that evening down the \textsc{Mallerstang} --\\
Thon was a blizzard, thon, and he was done\\
And almost dropping, when he came a bang\\
Against a house -- slap-bang, and like to stun.\\
Though that just saved his senses: and right there\\
He saw a lighted window he'd not seen,\\
Although he'd nearly staggered through its glare\\
Into a goodwife's kitchen, where she'd been\\
Baking hot griddle-cakes upon the peat...\\
And he could taste them now, and feel the glow\\
Of steady, aching, tingly, drowsy heat\\
As he sat there and let the caking snow\\
Melt off his boots, staining the sanded floor.\\
And that brown jug she took down from the shelf --\\
And every time he'd finished fetching more\\
And piping, `Now reach up and help yourself!'\\
She was a wonder, thon, the gay old wife --\\
But no such luck this journey. Things like that\\
Could hardly happen every day of life,\\
Or no one would be dying but the fat\\
And oily undertakers, starved to death\\
For want of custom... Hell, but he would soon\\
Be giving them a job... It caught your breath,\\
That throttling wind. And it was not yet noon.\\
And he'd be travelling through it until dark.\\
Dark! 'Twas already dark, and might be night\\
For all that he could see. And not a spark\\
Of comfort for him. Just to strike a light\\
And press the kindling shag down in the bowl,\\
Keeping the flame well shielded with his hand,\\
And puff \& puff! He'd give his very soul\\
For \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} a pipe. He couldn't understand\\
How he had come to lose it. He'd the rum --\\
Ay, that was safe enough, but it would keep\\
A while: you never knew what chance might come\\
In such a storm... If he could only sleep...\\
If he could only sleep... That rustling sound\\
Of drifting snow, it made him sleepy-like --\\
Drowsy \& dizzy, dithering round \& round...\\
If he could only curl up under a dyke\\
And sleep \& sleep. ... It dazzled him, that white,\\
Drifting \& drifting round \& round \& round...\\
Just \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} a moment's snooze... He'd be all right.\\
It made his head quite dizzy, that dry sound\\
Of rustling snow: it made his head go round,\\
That rustling in his ears... and drifting, drifting...\\
If only he could sleep... He would sleep sound...\\
God, he was nearly gone... The storm was lifting;\\
And he'd run into something soft \& warm --\\
Slap into his own beasts, and never knew.\\
Huddled they were, bamboozled by the storm --\\
And little wonder either when it blew\\
A blasted blizzard. Still, they'd got to go:\\
They couldn't stand there snoozing until night.\\
But they were sniffing something in the snow:\\
'Twas that had stopped them, something big \& white --\\
A bundle -- nay, a woman... And she slept --\\
But it was death to sleep. He'd nearly dropped\\
Asleep himself. 'Twas well that he had kept\\
That rum, and lucky that the beasts had stopped.\\
Ay, it was well that he had kept the rum:\\
He liked his drink, but he had never cared\\
For soaking by himself \& sitting mum:\\*
Even the best rum tasted better shared.

{\vin} Northward he turneth through a little door,\\*
{\vin} And scarce three steps, ere music's golden tongue\\
{\vin} Flattered to tears this ag\`{e}d man \& poor;\\
{\vin} But no -- already had his deathbell rung;\\
{\vin} The joys of all his life were said \& sung:\\
{\vin} His was harsh penance on St \textit{Agnes}' Eve:\\
{\vin} Another way he went, and soon among\\
{\vin} Rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve,\\*
And all night kept awake, for sinners' sake to grieve.\\!

{\vin} That ancient beadsman heard the prelude soft;\\*
{\vin} And so it chanced, for many a door was wide,\\
{\vin} From hurry to \& fro. Soon, up aloft,\\
{\vin} The silver, snarling trumpets 'gan to chide:\\
{\vin} The level chambers, ready with their pride,\\
{\vin} Were glowing to receive a 1000 guests:\\
{\vin} The carv\`{e}d angels, ever eager-eyed,\\
{\vin} Star, where upon their heads the cornice rests,\\*
With hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts.\\!

{\vin} At length burst in the argent revelry,\\*
{\vin} With plume, tiara, \& all rich array,\\
{\vin} Numerous as shadows haunting faerily\\
{\vin} The brain, new-stuffed, in youth, with triumphs gay\\
{\vin} Of old romance. These let us wish away,\\
{\vin} And turn, sole-thoughted, to one lady there,\\
{\vin} Whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day,\\
{\vin} On love, and winged St \textit{Agnes}' saintly care,\\*
As she had heard old dames full many times declare.\\!

{\vin} They told her how, upon St \textit{Agnes}' Eve,\\*
{\vin} Young virgins might have visions of delight,\\
{\vin} And soft adorings from their loves receive\\
{\vin} Upon the honeyed middle of the night,\\
{\vin} If ceremonies due they did aright;\\
{\vin} As, supperless to bed they must retire,\\
{\vin} And couch supine their beauties, lily white;\\
{\vin} Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require\\*
Of heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire.\\!

{\vin} Full of this whim was thoughtful \textit{Madeline}:\\*
{\vin} The music, yearning like a God in pain,\\
{\vin} She scarcely heard: her maiden eyes divine,\\
{\vin} Fixed on the floor, saw many a sweeping train\\
{\vin} Pass by -- she heeded not at all: in vain\\
{\vin} Came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier,\\
{\vin} And back retired; not cooled by high disdain,\\
{\vin} But she saw not: her heart was otherwhere:\\*
She sighed for \textit{Agnes}' dreams, the sweetest of the year.\\!

{\vin} She danced along with vague, regardless eyes,\\*
{\vin} Anxious her lips, her breathing quick \& short:\\
{\vin} The hallowed hour was near at hand: she sighs\\
{\vin} Amid the timbrels, and the thronged resort\\
{\vin} Of whisperers in anger, or in sport;\\
{\vin} 'Mid looks of love, defiance, hate, \& scorn,\\
{\vin} Hoodwinked with faery fancy; all amort,\\
{\vin} Save to St \textit{Agnes} \& her lambs unshorn,\\*
And all the bliss to be before tomorrow morn.\\!

{\vin} So, purposing each moment to retire,\\*
{\vin} She lingered still. Meantime, across the moors,\\
{\vin} Had come young \textit{Porphyro}, with heart on fire\\
{\vin} For \textit{Madeline}. Beside the portal doors,\\
{\vin} Buttressed from moonlight, stands he, and implores\\
{\vin} All saints to give him sight of \textit{Madeline},\\
{\vin} But for one moment in the tedious hours,\\
{\vin} That he might gaze \& worship all unseen;\\*
Perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss -- in sooth such things have been.\\!

{\vin} He ventures in: let no buzzed whisper tell:\\*
{\vin} All eyes be muffled, or a 100 swords\\
{\vin} Will storm his heart, love's fev'rous citadel:\\
{\vin} For him, those chambers held barbarian hordes,\\
{\vin} Hyena foemen, \& hot-blooded lords,\\
{\vin} Whose very dogs would execrations howl\\
{\vin} Against his lineage: not one breast affords\\
{\vin} Him any mercy, in that mansion foul,\\*
Save one old beldame, weak in body \& in soul.\\!

{\vin} Ah -- happy chance! -- the ag\`{e}d creature came,\\*
{\vin} Shuffling along with ivory-headed wand,\\
{\vin} To where he stood, hid from the torch's flame,\\
{\vin} Behind a broad half-pillar, far beyond\\
{\vin} The sound of merriment \& chorus bland:\\
{\vin} He startled her; but soon she knew his face,\\
{\vin} And grasped his fingers in her palsied hand,\\
{\vin} Saying, `Mercy, \textit{Porphyro}! hie thee from this place;\\*
They are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race!\\!

{\vin} `Get hence! Get hence! There's dwarfish \textit{Hildebrand};\\*
{\vin} He had a fever late, and in the fit\\
{\vin} He curs\`{e}d thee \& thine, both house \& land:\\
{\vin} Then there's that old Lord Maurice, not a whit\\
{\vin} More tame for his gray hairs -- Alas me! Flit!\\
{\vin} Flit like a ghost away.' `Ah, gossip dear,\\
{\vin} We're safe enough; here in this armchair sit,\\
{\vin} And tell me how' -- `Good saints! Not here, not here;\\*
Follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier.'\\!

{\vin} He followed through a lowly arch\`{e}d way,\\*
{\vin} Brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume,\\
{\vin} And as she muttered, `Well-a—well-a-day!'\\
{\vin} He found him in a little moonlight room,\\
{\vin} Pale, latticed, chill, \& silent as a tomb.\\
{\vin} `Now tell me where is \textit{Madeline},' said he,\\
{\vin} `O tell me, \textit{Angela}, by the holy loom\\
{\vin} Which none but secret sisterhood may see,\\*
When they St \textit{Agnes}' wool are weaving piously.'\\!

{\vin} `St \textit{Agnes}! Ah! It is St \textit{Agnes}' Eve --\\*
{\vin} Yet men will murder upon holy days:\\
{\vin} Thou must hold water in a witch's sieve,\\
{\vin} And be liege-lord of all the elves \& fays,\\
{\vin} To venture so: it fills me with amaze\\
{\vin} To see thee, \textit{Porphyro}! St \textit{Agnes}' Eve!\\
{\vin} God's help! my lady fair the conjuror plays\\
{\vin} This very night: good angels her deceive!\\*
But let me laugh awhile, I've mickle time to grieve.'\\!

{\vin} Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon,\\*
{\vin} While \textit{Porphyro} upon her face doth look,\\
{\vin} Like puzzled urchin on an ag\`{e}d crone\\
{\vin} Who keepeth closed a wond'rous riddle-book,\\
{\vin} As spectacled she sits in chimney nook.\\
{\vin} But soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told\\
{\vin} His lady's purpose; and he scarce could brook\\
{\vin} Tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold,\\*
And \textit{Madeline} asleep in lap of legends old.\\!

{\vin} Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,\\*
{\vin} Flushing his brow, and in his pain\`{e}d heart\\
{\vin} Made purple riot: then doth he propose\\
{\vin} A stratagem, that makes the beldame start:\\
{\vin} `A cruel man \& impious thou art:\\
{\vin} Sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, \& dream\\
{\vin} Alone with her good angels, far apart\\
{\vin} From wicked men like thee. Go! Go! I deem\\*
Thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem.'\\!

{\vin} `I will not harm her, by all saints I swear,'\\*
{\vin} Quoth \textit{Porphyro}: `O may I ne'er find grace\\
{\vin} When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer,\\
{\vin} If one of her soft ringlets I displace,\\
{\vin} Or look with ruffian passion in her face:\\
{\vin} Good \textit{Angela}, believe me by these tears;\\
{\vin} Or I will, even in a moment's space,\\
{\vin} Awake, with horrid shout, my foemen's ears,\\*
And beard them, though they be more fanged than wolves \& bears.'\\!

{\vin} `Ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul?\\*
{\vin} A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing,\\
{\vin} Whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll;\\
{\vin} Whose prayers for thee, each morn \& evening,\\
{\vin} Were never missed.' Thus plaining, doth she bring\\
{\vin} A gentler speech from burning \textit{Porphyro};\\
{\vin} So woful, and of such deep sorrowing,\\
{\vin} That \textit{Angela} gives promise she will do\\*
Whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe.\\!

{\vin} Which was, to lead him, in close secrecy,\\*
{\vin} Even to \textit{Madeline}'s chamber, and there hide\\
{\vin} Him in a closet, of such privacy\\
{\vin} That he might see her beauty unespyed,\\
{\vin} And win perhaps that night a peerless bride,\\
{\vin} While legioned faeries paced the coverlet,\\
{\vin} And pale enchantment held her sleepy-eyed.\\
{\vin} Never on such a night have lovers met,\\*
Since \textit{Merlin} paid his demon all the monstrous debt.\\!

{\vin} `It shall be as thou wishest,' said the dame:\\*
{\vin} `All cates \& dainties shall be stor\`{e}d there\\
{\vin} Quickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame\\
{\vin} Her own lute thou wilt see: no time to spare,\\
{\vin} For I am slow \& feeble, and scarce dare\\
{\vin} On such a catering trust my dizzy head.\\
{\vin} Wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer\\
{\vin} The while: Ah! thou must needs the lady wed,\\*
Or may I never leave my grave among the dead.'\\!

{\vin} So saying, she hobbled off with busy fear.\\*
{\vin} The lover's endless minutes slowly passed;\\
{\vin} The dame returned, and whispered in his ear\\
{\vin} To follow her; with ag\`{e}d eyes aghast\\
{\vin} From fright of dim espial. Safe at last,\\
{\vin} Through many a dusky gallery, they gain\\
{\vin} The maiden's chamber, silken, hushed, \& chaste;\\
{\vin} Where \textit{Porphyro} took covert, pleased amain.\\*
His poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain.\\!

{\vin} Her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade,\\*
{\vin} Old \textit{Angela} was feeling for the stair,\\
{\vin} When \textit{Madeline}, St \textit{Agnes}' charm\`{e}d maid,\\
{\vin} Rose, like a missioned spirit, unaware:\\
{\vin} With silver taper's light, \& pious care,\\
{\vin} She turned, and down the ag\`{e}d gossip led\\
{\vin} To a safe level matting. Now prepare,\\
{\vin} Young \textit{Porphyro}, for gazing on that bed;\\*
She comes, she comes again, like ring-dove frayed \& fled.\\!

{\vin} Out went the taper as she hurried in;\\*
{\vin} Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died:\\
{\vin} She closed the door, she panted, all akin\\
{\vin} To spirits of the air, \& visions wide:\\
{\vin} No uttered syllable, or, woe betide!\\
{\vin} But to her heart, her heart was voluble,\\
{\vin} Paining with eloquence her balmy side;\\
{\vin} As though a tongueless nightingale should swell\\*
Her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell.\\!

{\vin} A casement high \& triple-arched there was,\\*
{\vin} All garlanded with carven imag'ries\\
{\vin} Of fruits, \& flowers, \& bunches of knot-grass,\\
{\vin} And diamonded with panes of quaint device,\\
{\vin} Innumerable of stains \& splendid dyes,\\
{\vin} As are the tiger-moth's deep-damasked wings;\\
{\vin} And in the midst, 'mong 1000 heraldries,\\
{\vin} And twilight saints, \& dim emblazonings,\\*
A shielded scutcheon blushed with blood of queens \& kings.\\!

{\vin} Full on this casement shone the wintry moon,\\*
{\vin} And threw warm gules on \textit{Madeline}'s fair breast,\\
{\vin} As down she knelt for heaven's grace \& boon;\\
{\vin} Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,\\
{\vin} And on her silver cross soft amethyst,\\
{\vin} And on her hair a glory, like a saint:\\
{\vin} She seemed a splendid angel, newly dressed,\\
{\vin} Save wings, for heaven: \textit{Porphyro} grew faint:\\*
She knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.\\!

{\vin} Anon his heart revives: her vespers done,\\*
{\vin} Of all its wreath\`{e}d pearls her hair she frees;\\
{\vin} Unclasps her warm\`{e}d jewels one by one;\\
{\vin} Loosens her fragrant boddice; by degrees\\
{\vin} Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees:\\
{\vin} Half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed,\\
{\vin} Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees,\\
{\vin} In fancy, fair St Agnes in her bed,\\*
But dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled.\\!

{\vin} Soon, trembling in her soft \& chilly nest,\\*
{\vin} In sort of wakeful swoon, perplexed she lay,\\
{\vin} Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppressed\\
{\vin} Her sooth\`{e}d limbs, \& soul fatigued away;\\
{\vin} Flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day;\\
{\vin} Blissfully havened both from joy \& pain;\\
{\vin} Clasped like a missal where swart paynims pray;\\
{\vin} Blinded alike from sunshine \& from rain,\\*
As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again.\\!

{\vin} Stol'n to this paradise, and so entranced,\\*
{\vin} \textit{Porphyro} gazed upon her empty dress,\\
{\vin} And listened to her breathing, if it chanced\\
{\vin} To wake into a slumberous tenderness;\\
{\vin} Which when he heard, that minute did he bless,\\
{\vin} And breathed himself: then from the closet crept,\\
{\vin} Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness,\\
{\vin} And over the hushed carpet, silent, stept,\\*
And 'tween the curtains peeped, where -- lo! -- how fast she slept.\\!

{\vin} Then by the bed-side, where the faded moon\\*
{\vin} Made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set\\
{\vin} A table, and, \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} anguished, threw thereon\\
{\vin} A cloth of woven crimson, gold, \& jet:\\
{\vin} O for some drowsy morphean amulet!\\
{\vin} The boisterous, midnight, festive clarion,\\
{\vin} The kettle-drum, \& far-heard clarinet,\\
{\vin} Affray his ears, though but in dying tone:\\*
The hall-door shuts again, and all the noise is gone.\\!

{\vin} And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep,\\*
{\vin} In blanch\`{e}d linen, smooth, \& lavendered,\\
{\vin} While he forth from the closet brought a heap\\
{\vin} Of candied apple, quince, \& plum, \& gourd;\\
{\vin} With jellies soother than the creamy curd,\\
{\vin} And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon;\\
{\vin} Manna \& dates, in argosy transferred\\
{\vin} From \textsc{Fez}; \& spic\`{e}d dainties, every one,\\*
From silken \textsc{Samarcand} to cedared Lebanon.\\!

{\vin} These delicates he heaped with glowing hand\\*
{\vin} On golden dishes \& in baskets bright\\
{\vin} Of wreath\`{e}d silver: sumptuous they stand\\
{\vin} In the retir\`{e}d quiet of the night,\\
{\vin} Filling the chilly room with perfume light.\\
{\vin} `And now, my love, my seraph fair, awake!\\
{\vin} Thou art my heaven, and I thine eremite:\\
{\vin} Open thine eyes, for meek St \textit{Agnes}' sake,\\*
Or I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache.'\\!

{\vin} Thus whispering, his warm, unnerv\`{e}d arm\\*
{\vin} Sank in her pillow. Shaded was her dream\\
{\vin} By the dusk curtains:—'twas a midnight charm\\
{\vin} Impossible to melt as ic\`{e}d stream:\\
{\vin} The lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam;\\
{\vin} Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies:\\
{\vin} It seemed he never, never could redeem\\
{\vin} From such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes;\\*
So mused awhile, entoiled in woof\`{e}d phantasies.\\!

{\vin} Awakening up, he took her hollow lute,\\*
{\vin} Tumultuous, and, in chords that tenderest be,\\
{\vin} He played an ancient ditty, long since mute,\\
{\vin} In Provence called, ``La belle dame sans mercy'':\\
{\vin} Close to her ear touching the melody;\\
{\vin} Wherewith disturbed, she uttered a soft moan:\\
{\vin} He ceased -- she panted quick -- and suddenly\\
{\vin} Her blue affray\`{e}d eyes wide open shone:\\*
Upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone.\\!

{\vin} Her eyes were open, but she still beheld,\\*
{\vin} Now wide awake, the vision of her sleep:\\
{\vin} There was a painful change, that nigh expelled\\
{\vin} The blisses of her dream so pure \& deep\\
{\vin} At which fair \textit{Madeline} began to weep,\\
{\vin} And moan forth witless words with many a sigh;\\
{\vin} While still her gaze on \textit{Porphyro} would keep;\\
{\vin} Who knelt, with join\`{e}d hands \& piteous eye,\\*
Fearing to move or speak, she looked so dreamingly.\\!

{\vin} `Ah, \textit{Porphyro}!' said she, `But even now\\*
{\vin} Thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear,\\
{\vin} Made tuneable with every sweetest vow;\\
{\vin} And those sad eyes were spiritual \& clear:\\
{\vin} How changed thou art! how pallid, chill, \& drear!\\
{\vin} Give me that voice again, my \textit{Porphyro},\\
{\vin} Those looks immortal, those complainings dear!\\
{\vin} O leave me not in this eternal woe,\\*
For if thy diest, my love, I know not where to go.'\\!

{\vin} Beyond a mortal man impassioned far\\*
{\vin} At these voluptuous accents, he arose\\
{\vin} Ethereal, flushed, and like a throbbing star\\
{\vin} Seen 'mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose;\\
{\vin} Into her dream he melted, as the rose\\
{\vin} Blendeth its odour with the violet --\\
{\vin} Solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows\\
{\vin} Like love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet\\*
Against the window-panes; St \textit{Agnes}' moon hath set.\\!

{\vin} 'Tis dark: quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet:\\*
{\vin} `This is no dream, my bride, my \textit{Madeline}!'\\
{\vin} 'Tis dark: the ic\`{e}d gusts still rave \& beat:\\
{\vin} `No dream, Alas! Alas! And woe is mine!\\
{\vin} \textit{Porphyro} will leave me here to fade \& pine.\\
{\vin} Cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring?\\
{\vin} I curse not, for my heart is lost in thine,\\
{\vin} Though thou forsakest a deceiv\`{e}d thing;\\*
A dove forlorn \& lost with sick unprun\`{e}d wing.'\\!

{\vin} `My \textit{Madeline}! sweet dreamer! lovely bride!\\*
{\vin} Say, may I be for aye thy vassal blest?\\
{\vin} Thy beauty's shield, heart-shaped \& vermeil-dyed?\\
{\vin} Ah silver shrine, here will I take my rest\\
{\vin} After so many hours of toil \& quest,\\
{\vin} A famished pilgrim, saved by miracle.\\
{\vin} Though I have found, I will not rob thy nest\\
{\vin} Saving of thy sweet self; if thou think'st well\\*
To trust, fair \textit{Madeline}, to no rude infidel.\\!

{\vin} `Hark! 'Tis an elfin-storm from faery land,\\*
{\vin} Of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed:\\
{\vin} Arise! Arise! the morning is at hand;\\
{\vin} The bloated wassaillers will never heed:\\
{\vin} Let us away, my love, with happy speed;\\
{\vin} There are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,\\
{\vin} Drowned all in rhenish \& the sleepy mead:\\
{\vin} Awake! Arise, my love, and fearless be,\\*
For o'er the southern moors I have a home for thee.'\\!

{\vin} She hurried at his words, beset with fears,\\*
{\vin} For there were sleeping dragons all around,\\
{\vin} At glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears,\\
{\vin} Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.\\
{\vin} In all the house was heard no human sound.\\
{\vin} A chain-drooped lamp was flickering by each door;\\
{\vin} The arras, rich with horseman, hawk, \& hound,\\
{\vin} Fluttered in the besieging wind's uproar;\\*
And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor.\\!

{\vin} They glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall;\\*
{\vin} Like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide;\\
{\vin} Where lay the porter, in uneasy sprawl,\\
{\vin} With a huge empty flaggon by his side:\\
{\vin} The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide,\\
{\vin} But his sagacious eye an inmate owns:\\
{\vin} By one, \& one, the bolts full easy slide:\\
{\vin} The chains lie silent on the footworn stones;\\*
The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans.\\!

{\vin} And they are gone: ay, ages long ago\\*
{\vin} These lovers fled away into the storm.\\
{\vin} That night the baron dreamt of many a woe,\\
{\vin} And all his warrior-guests, with shade \& form\\
{\vin} Of witch, \& demon, \& large coffin-worm,\\
{\vin} Were long be-nightmared. \textit{Angela} the old\\
{\vin} Died palsy-twitched, with meagre face deform;\\
{\vin} The beadsman, after 1000 aves told,\\*
For aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold.

I saw wherein the shroud did lurk\\*\footnotetext{`On an Infant Dying as Soon as Born', Charles Lamb (1775 -- 1834), \cite{treasury}.}
A curious frame of nature's work.\\
A flow'ret crush\`{e}d in the bud,\\
A nameless piece of babyhood,\\
Was in a cradle-coffin lying;\\
Extinct, with scarce the sense of dying;\\
So soon to exchange the imprisoning womb\\
For darker closets of the tomb!\\
She did but ope an eye, and put\\
A clear beam forth, then strait up shut\\
For the long dark: ne'er more to see\\
Through glasses of mortality.\\
Riddle of destiny, who can show\\
What thy short visit meant, or know\\
What thy errand here below?\\
Shall we say, that nature blind\\
Checked her hand, \& changed her mind,\\
Just when she had exactly wrought\\
A finished pattern without fault?\\
Could she flag, or could she tire,\\
Or lacked she the promethean fire\\
(With her nine moons' long workings sickened)\\
That should thy little limbs have quickened?\\
Limbs so firm, they seemed to assure\\
Life of health, and days mature:\\
Woman's self in miniature!\\
Limbs so fair, they might supply\\
(Themselves now but cold imagery)\\
The sculptor to make beauty by.\\
Or did the stern-eyed fate descry,\\
That babe, or mother, one must die;\\
So in mercy left the stock,\\
And cut the branch; to save the shock\\
Of young years widowed; and the pain,\\
When single state comes back again\\
To the lone man who, 'reft of wife,\\
Thenceforward drags a maimed life?\\
The economy of heaven is dark;\\
And wisest clerks have missed the mark,\\
Why human buds, like this, should fall,\\
More brief than fly ephemeral,\\
That has his day; while shrivelled crones\\
Stiffen with age to stocks \& stones;\\
And crabb\`{e}d use the conscience sears\\
In sinners of an hundred years.\\
Mother's prattle, mother's kiss,\\
Baby fond, thou ne'er wilt miss.\\
Rites, which custom does impose,\\
Silver bells \& baby clothes;\\
Coral redder than those lips,\\
Which pale death did late eclipse;\\
Music framed for infants' glee,\\
Whistle never tuned for thee;\\
Though thou want'st not, thou shalt have them,\\
Loving hearts were they which gave them.\\
Let not one be missing; nurse,\\
See them laid upon the hearse\\
Of infant slain by doom perverse.\\
Why should kings \& nobles have\\
Pictured trophies to their grave;\\
And we, churls, to thee deny\\
Thy pretty toys with thee to lie,\\*
A more harmless vanity?

The Helen in question is the same woman whose beauty sparked the Trojan War. Corythos -- the name is usually Latinised as Corythus, from the Greek Κόρυθος -- was the son of Paris and Oenone; his mother sent the young man to Troy, where he and Helen fell in love with each other; Paris, not recognising his own son, killed him out of jealousy.}
And fondness he refreshed: her anxious thoughts\\
Followed, and upon \textit{Corythos} they dwelt.\\
Often he met her eyes, nor shunned they his.\\
For, royal as she was and born of \textit{Zeus},\\
She was compassionate, and bowed her head\\
To share her smiles \& griefs with those below.\\
All in her sight were level, for she stood\\
High above all within the sea-girt world.\\
At last she questioned \textit{Corythos} what brought\\
His early footsteps through such dangerous ways.\\
And from abode so peaceable \& safe.\\
At once he told her why he came: she held\\

Not to have hated her: he looked; he sighed.\\
He hung upon her words. What gentle words!\\

Folding around my soul \& spirit, around my lips\\
So sweet, like a swoon, or more like the drowse of a low, sad song\\
Singing darker than the nightingale, on, on to the solstice\\
And the silence of short days, the silence of the year, the shadow,\\
Then I shall know that my life is moving still\\
With the dark earth, and drenched\\*

And if, in the changing phases of man's life,\\*
I fall in sickness \& in misery;\\
My wrists seem broken and my heart seems dead\\
And strength is gone, and my life\\*
Is only the leavings of a life:\\!

And still, among it all, snatches of lovely oblivion, and snatches\\*
Of renewal\\
Odd, wintry flowers upon the withered stem, yet new, strange flowers\\*
Such as my life has not brought forth before, new blossoms of me\\!

Then I must know that still\\*
I am in the hands of the unknown God;\\
He is breaking me down to his own oblivion\\*
To send me forth on a new morning, a new man.

William McGonagall (his knighthood would seem to have been self-bestowed; but where's the harm in that?) is often said to be the worst poet in the English language, and this his worst poem. Yet the Almanackist cannot help but discern a particular kind of genius in his works, rarely seen outside of the writings of Joseph Smith and L Ron Hubbard. The disaster described was indeed a genuine tragedy, and remains the most lethal British railway disaster to this day.}
Alas! I am very sorry to say\\
That 90 lives have been taken away\\
On the last sabbath day of eighteen seventy-nine,\\*
Which will be remembered for a very long time.\\!

'Twas about seven o'clock at night,\\*
And the wind it blew with all its might,\\
And the rain came pouring down,\\
And the dark clouds seemed to frown,\\
And the demon of the air seemed to say,\\*
`I'll blow down the \textsc{Bridge of Tay}.'\\!

When the train left \textsc{Edinburgh}\\*
The passengers' hearts were light \& felt no sorrow,\\
But \textit{Boreas} blew a terrific gale,\\
Which made their hearts for to quail,\\
And many of the passengers with fear did say,\\*
`I hope God will send us safe across the \textsc{Bridge of Tay}.'\\!

But when the train came near to \textsc{Wormit Bay},\\*
\textit{Boreas} he did loud \& angry bray,\\
And shook the central girders of the \textsc{Bridge of Tay}\\
On the last sabbath day of eighteen seventy-nine,\\*
Which will be remembered for a very long time.\\!

So the train sped on with all its might,\\*
And bonny \textsc{Dundee} soon hove in sight,\\
And the passengers' hearts felt light,\\
Thinking they would enjoy themselves on the New Year,\\
With their friends at home they loved most dear,\\*
And wish them all a happy New Year.\\!

So the train moved slowly along the \textsc{Bridge of Tay},\\*
Until it was about midway,\\
Then the central girders with a crash gave way,\\
And down went the train \& passengers into the \textsc{Tay}!\\
The storm fiend did loudly bray,\\
Because 90 lives had been taken away,\\
On the last sabbath day of eighteen seventy-nine,\\*
Which will be remembered for a very long time.\\!

As soon as the catastrophe came to be known\\*
The alarm from mouth to mouth was blown,\\
And the cry rang out all o'er the town:\\
Good Heavens! The \textsc{Tay Bridge} is blown down,\\
And a passenger train from Edinburgh,\\
Which filled all the people's hearts with sorrow,\\
And made them for to turn pale,\\
Because none of the passengers were saved to tell the tale\\
How the disaster happened on the last sabbath day of eighteen seventy-nine,\\*
Which will be remembered for a very long time.\\!

It must have been an awful sight,\\*
To witness in the dusky moonlight,\\
While the storm fiend did laugh, and angry did bray,\\
Along the \textsc{Railway Bridge} of the silvery \textsc{Tay}.\\
O ill-fated \textsc{Bridge} of the silvery \textsc{Tay},\\
I must now conclude my lay\\
By telling the world fearlessly without the least dismay,\\
That your central girders would not have given way,\\
At least many sensible men do say,\\
Had they been supported on each side with buttresses,\\
At least many sensible men confesses,\\
For the stronger we our houses do build,\\*
The less chance we have of being killed.

O'erturns, at once. Prone, on th'uncertain main,\\
Descends th'ethereal force, and ploughs its waves,\\

Surge after surge, the rising watery war.\\
Whitening, the angry billows rowl immense,\\
And roar their rerrors, through the shuddering soul\\
Of feeble man, amidst their fury caught,\\
And dashed upon his fate: then, o'er the cliff,\\
Where dwells the sea-mew, unconfined, they fly,\\*

Stoop to the bottom of the rocks they shade:\\
Lone on its midnight side, and all aghast,\\

I was a stricken deer that left the herd\\*\footnotetext{$\mathbb{R}$ `The Stricken Deer', William Cowper (1731 -- 1800), \cite{londonbook}. \P 144. Pilgrims to the oracle at Delphi would first wash themselves in the Castalian spring. Drinking therefrom was said to induce poetical inspiration. \P 150. Themis was a Greek goddess of prophecy, named in some sources as the mother of Prometheus. \P 151. `Immortal Hale' = Sir Matthew Hale.}
Long since, with many an arrow deep infixed\\
My panting side was charged, when I withdrew\\
To seek a tranquil death in distant shades.\\
There was I found by one who had himself\\
Been hurt by th'archers. In his side he bore,\\
And in his hands \& feet, the cruel scars.\\
With gentle force soliciting the darts,\\
He drew them forth, and healed and bade me live.\\
Since then, with few associates, in remote\\
And silent woods I wander, far from those,\\
My former partners of the peopled scene;\\
With few associates, and not wishing more.\\
Here much I ruminate, as much I may,\\
With other views of men and manners now\\
Than once, and others of a life to come.\\
I see that all are wanderers, gone astray\\
Each in his own delusions; they are lost\\
In chase of fancied happiness, still wooed\\
And never won. Dream after dream ensues,\\
And still they dream that they shall still succeed,\\
And still are disappointed. Rings the world\\
With the vain stir. I sum up \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} mankind\\
And add two thirds of the remaining \sfrac{$1$}{$2$},\\
And find the total of their hopes \& fears\\
Dreams, empty dreams. The million flit as gay,\\
As if created only like the fly,\\
That spreads his motley wings in the eye of noon\\
To sport their season and be seen no more.\\
The rest aro sober dreamers, grave \& wise\\
And pregnant with discoveries new \& rare.\\
Somo write a narrative of wars \& feats,\\
Of heroes little known, and call the rant\\
A history; describe the man, of whom\\
His own coevals took but little note,\\
And paint his person, character, \& views,\\
As they had know him from his mother womb.\\
They disentangle from the puzzled skein\\
In which obscurity has wrapped them up,\\
The threads of politic \& shrewd design\\
That ran through all his purposes, and charge\\
His mind with meanings that he never had\\
Or having, kept concealed. Some drill \& bore\\
The solid earth, and from the strata there\\
Extract a register, by which we learn\\
That he, who made it and revealed its date\\
To \textit{Moses}, was mistaken in its age.\\
Some, more acute \& more industrious still,\\
Contrive creation, travel nature up\\
To the sharp peak of her sublimest height,\\
Tell us whence the stars, why some are fixed,\\
And planetary some, what gave them first\\
Rotation, from what fountain flowed their light.\\
Great contest follows, and much learned dust\\
Involves the combatants, each claiming truth,\\
And truth disclaiming both. And thus they spend\\
The little wick of life's poor shallow lamp\\
In playing tricks with nature, giving laws\\
To distant worlds, and trifling in their own.\\
Is't not a pity now, that tickling rheums\\
Should ever tease the lungs, and blear the sight\\
Of oracles like these. Great pity too\\
That having wielded the elements, and built\\
A 1000 systems, each in his own way,\\
They should go out in fame and be forgot!\\
Ah what is life thus spent? And what are they\\
But frantic who thus spend it? All for smoke --\\
Eternity for bubbles proves at last\\
A senseless bargain. When I see such games\\
Played by the creatures of a power who swears\\
That he will judge the earth, and call the fool\\
To a sharp reckoning that has lived in vain;\\
And when I weigh this seeming wisdom well,\\
And prove it the infallible result\\
So hollow and so false -- I feel my heart\\
Dissolve in pity, and account the learned,\\
If this be learning, most of all deceived.\\
Great crimes alarm the conscience, but it sleeps\\
While thoughtful man is plausibly amused.\\
Defend me therefore, common sense, say I,\\
Prom reveries so airy, from the toil\\
Of dropping buckets into empty wells,\\*
And growing old in drawing nothing up!\\!

'Twere well says one sage erudite, profound,\\*
Terribly arched \& aquiline his nose,\\
And overbuilt with most impending brows,\\
'Twere well could you permit the world to live\\
As the world pleases. What's the world to you?\\
Much. I was born of woman, and drew milk,\\
As sweet as charity, from human breasts.\\
I think, articulate; I laugh and weep\\
And exercise all functions of a man.\\
How then should I and any man that lives\\
Be strangers to each other? Pierce my vein;\\
Take of the crimson stream meandering there,\\
And catechise it well. Apply your glass,\\
Search it, and prove now if it be not blood\\
Congenial with thine own: and if it be,\\
With edge of subtlety canst thou suppose\\
Keen enough, wise \& skilful as thou art,\\
To cut the link of brotherhood, by which\\
One common maker bound me to the kind.\\
True; I am no proficient, I confess,\\
In arts like yours I cannot call the swift\\
And perilous lightnings from the angry clouds,\\
And bid them hide themselves in th'earth beneath;\\
I cannot analyse the air, nor catch\\
The parallax of yonder luminous point\\
That seems \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} quenched in the immense abyss;\\
Such powers I boast not -- neither can I rest\\
A silent witness of the headlong rage,\\
Or heedless folly by which thousands die,\\*
Bone of my bone, \& kindred souls to mine.\\!

God never meant that man should scale the heavens\\*
By strides of human wisdom. In his works,\\
Though wondrous, he commands us in his word\\
To seek him rather where his mercy shines.\\
The mind indeed, enlightened from above,\\
Views him in all; ascribes to the grand cause\\
The grand eflect, acknowledges with joy\\
His manner, and with rapture tastes his style.\\
But never yet did philosophic tube\\
That brings the planets home into the eye\\
Of observation, and discovers, else\\
Not visible, his family of worlds,\\
Discover him that rules them: such a veil\\
Hangs oyer mortal eyes, blind from the birth,\\
And dark in things divine. Full often too\\
Our wayward intellect, the more we learn\\
Of nature, overlooks her author more;\\
From instrumental causes proud to draw\\
Conclusions retrograde, and mad mistake.\\
But if his word once teach us, shoot a ray\\
Through all the heart's dark chambers, and reveal\\
Truths undiscernd but by that holy light,\\
Then all is plain. Philosophy baptised\\
In the pure fountain of eternal love\\
Has eyes indeed; and viewing all she sees,\\
As meant to indicate a God to man,\\
Gives him his praise, and forfeits not her own.\\
Learning has borne such fruit in other days\\
On all her branches: piety has found\\
Friends in the friends of science, and true prayer\\
Has flowed from lips wet with castalian dews.\\
Such was thy wisdom, \textit{Newton}, childlike sage,\\
Sagacious reader of the works of God,\\
And in his word sagacious. Such too thine,\\
\textit{Milton}, whose genius had angelic wings,\\
And fed on manna. And such thine, in whom\\
Our british \textit{Themis} gloried with just cause,\\
Immortal \textit{Hale}, for deep discernment praised,\\
And sound integrity not more, than famed\\*
For sanctity of manners undefiled.

Lady Dyer had this remarkable epitaph inscribed on the monument of her late husband, Sir William Dyer (1583 -- 1621), which can be found in St Denys' Church in the village of Colmworth, Bedfordshire. This sonnet is actually just the second half of the complete epitaph. \P 12. There is some ambiguity in this line: some books gives `my blood grows cold', while others give `my beloved grows' cold. The Almanackist is no scholar of seventeenth century English orthography, but he has seen the original monument himself, and can report that it reads `MY BLOVD GROWES COLD', and thus he concludes that either interpretation may be correct.}

Farewell, too little \& too lately known,\\*\footnotetext{`To the Memory of Mr Oldham', John Dryden, Poet Laureate (1631 -- 1700), \cite{norton}. \P 10.

It might (what nature never gives the young)\\

But satire needs not those, and wit will shine\\
Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line.\\
A noble error, and but seldom made,\\
When poets are by too much force betrayed.\\
Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime\\
Still showed a quickness; and maturing time\\
But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhyme.\\
Once more, hail \& farewell; farewell thou young,\\
But ah too short, \textit{Marcellus} of our tongue;\\
Thy brows with ivy, and with laurels bound;\\*

\settowidth{\versewidth}{They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
When I see birches bend to left \& right\\*\footnotetext{`Birches', Robert Frost, Poet Laureate of Vermont (1874 -- 1963), \cite{norton}.}
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,\\
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.\\
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay\\
As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them\\
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning\\
After a rain. They click upon themselves\\
As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured\\
As the stir cracks \& crazes their enamel.\\
Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells\\
Shattering \& avalanching on the snow-crust --\\
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away\\
You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.\\
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,\\
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed\\
So low for long, they never right themselves:\\
You may see their trunks arching in the woods\\
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground\\
Like girls on hands \& knees that throw their hair\\
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.\\
But I was going to say when truth broke in\\
With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm\\
I should prefer to have some boy bend them\\
As he went out \& in to fetch the cows --\\
Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,\\
Whose only play was what he found himself,\\
Summer or winter, and could play alone.\\
One by one he subdued his father's trees\\
By riding them down over \& over again\\
Until he took the stiffness out of them,\\
And not one but hung limp, not one was left\\
For him to conquer. He learned all there was\\
To learn about not launching out too soon\\
And so not carrying the tree away\\
Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise\\
To the top branches, climbing carefully\\
With the same pains you use to fill a cup\\
Up to the brim, and even above the brim.\\
Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,\\
Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.\\
So was I once myself a swinger of birches.\\
And so I dream of going back to be.\\
It's when I'm weary of considerations,\\
And life is too much like a pathless wood\\
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs\\
Broken across it, and one eye is weeping\\
From a twig's having lashed across it open.\\
I'd like to get away from earth awhile\\
And then come back to it and begin over.\\
May no fate wilfully misunderstand me\\
And \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} grant what I wish \& snatch me away\\
Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:\\
I don't know where it's likely to go better.\\
I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,\\
And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk\\
Tow\'{a}rd heaven, till the tree could bear no more,\\
But dipped its top and set me down again.\\
That would be good both going \& coming back.\\*
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.

{\vin} Than love; the hidden well-water\\
Is not so delicate to drink:\\*
{\vin} This was well seen of me \& her.\\!

I served her in a royal house;\\*
{\vin} I served her wine \& curious meat.\\
For will to kiss between her brows,\\*
{\vin} I had no heart to sleep or eat.\\!

Mere scorn God knows she had of me,\\*
{\vin} A poor scribe, nowise great or fair,\\
Who plucked his clerk's hood back to see\\*
{\vin} Her curled-up lips \& amorous hair.\\!

I vex my head with thinking this.\\*
{\vin} Yea, though God always hated me,\\
And hates me now that I can kiss\\*
{\vin} Her eyes, plait up her hair to see\\!

How she then wore it on the brows,\\*
{\vin} Yet am I glad to have her dead\\
Here in this wretched wattled house\\*
{\vin} Where I can kiss her eyes \& head.\\!

Nothing is better, I well know,\\*
{\vin} Than love; no amber in cold sea\\
Or gathered berries under snow:\\*
{\vin} That is well seen of her \& me.\\!

Three thoughts I make my pleasure of:\\*
{\vin} First I take heart \& think of this:\\
That knight's gold hair she chose to love,\\*
{\vin} His mouth she had such will to kiss.\\!

Then I remember that sundawn\\*
{\vin} I brought him by a privy way\\
Out at her lattice, and thereon\\*
{\vin} What gracious words she found to say.\\!

(Cold rushes for such little feet —\\*
{\vin} Both feet could lie into my hand.\\
A marvel was it of my sweet\\*
{\vin} Her upright body could so stand.)\\!

`Sweet friend, God give you thank \& grace;\\*
{\vin} Now am I clean \& whole of shame,\\
Nor shall men burn me in the face\\*
{\vin} For my sweet fault that scandals them.'\\!

I tell you over word by word.\\*
{\vin} She, sitting edgewise on her bed,\\
Holding her feet, said thus. The third,\\*
{\vin} A sweeter thing than these, I said.\\!

God, that makes time and ruins it\\*
{\vin} And alters not, abiding God,\\
Changed with disease her body sweet,\\*
{\vin} The body of love wherein she abode.\\!

Love is more sweet \& comelier\\*
{\vin} Than a dove's throat strained out to sing.\\
All they spat out and cursed at her\\*
{\vin} And cast her forth for a base thing.\\!

They cursed her, seeing how God had wrought\\*
{\vin} This curse to plague her, a curse of his.\\
Fools were they surely, seeing not\\*
{\vin} How sweeter than all sweet she is.\\!

He that had held her by the hair,\\*
{\vin} With kissing lips blinding her eyes,\\
Felt her bright bosom, strained \& bare,\\*
{\vin} Sigh under him, with short mad cries\\!

Out of her throat \& sobbing mouth\\*
{\vin} And body broken up with love,\\
With sweet hot tears his lips were loth\\*
{\vin} Her own should taste the savour of,\\!

Yea, he inside whose grasp all night\\*
{\vin} Her fervent body leapt or lay,\\
Stained with sharp kisses red \& white,\\*
{\vin} Found her a plague to spurn away.\\!

I hid her in this wattled house,\\*
{\vin} I served her water \& poor bread.\\
For joy to kiss between her brows\\*
{\vin} Time upon time I was nigh dead.\\!

Bread failed; we got but well-water\\*
{\vin} And gathered grass with dropping seed.\\
I had such joy of kissing her,\\*
{\vin} I had small care to sleep or feed.\\!

Sometimes when service made me glad\\*
{\vin} The sharp tears leapt between my lids,\\
Falling on her, such joy I had\\*
{\vin} To do the service God forbids.\\!

`I pray you let me be at peace;\\*
{\vin} Get hence, make room for me to die.'\\
She said that: her poor lip would cease,\\*
{\vin} Put up to mine, and turn to cry.\\!

I said, `Bethink yourself how love\\*
{\vin} Fared in us twain, what either did;\\
Shall I unclothe my soul thereof?\\*
{\vin} That I should do this, God forbid.'\\!

Yea, though God hateth us, he knows\\*
{\vin} That hardly in a little thing\\
Love faileth of the work it does\\*
{\vin} Till it grow ripe for gathering.\\!

Six months, and now my sweet is dead\\*
{\vin} A trouble takes me; I know not\\
If all were done well, all well said,\\*
{\vin} No word or tender deed forgot.\\!

Too sweet, for the least part in her,\\*
{\vin} To have shed life out by fragments; yet,\\
Could the close mouth catch breath and stir,\\*
{\vin} I might see something I forget.\\!

Six months, and I sit still and hold\\*
{\vin} In two cold palms her cold two feet.\\
Her hair, \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} grey \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} ruined gold,\\*
{\vin} Thrills me and burns me in kissing it.\\!

Love bites and stings me through, to see\\*
{\vin} Her keen face made of sunken bones.\\
Her worn-off eyelids madden me,\\*
{\vin} That were shot through with purple once.\\!

She said, `Be good with me; I grow\\*
{\vin} So tired for shame's sake, I shall die\\
If you say nothing:' even so.\\*
{\vin} And she is dead now, and shame put by.\\!

Yea, and the scorn she had of me\\*
{\vin} In the old time, doubtless vexed her then.\\
I never should have kissed her. See\\*
{\vin} What fools God's anger makes of men!\\!

She might have loved me a little too,\\*
{\vin} Had I been humbler for her sake.\\
But that new shame could make love new\\*
{\vin} She saw not -- yet her shame did make.\\!

I took too much upon my love,\\*
{\vin} Having for such mean service done\\
Her beauty \& all the ways thereof,\\*
{\vin} Her face \& all the sweet thereon.\\!

Yea, all this while I tended her,\\*
{\vin} I know the old love held fast his part:\\
I know the old scorn waxed heavier,\\*
{\vin} Mixed with sad wonder, in her heart.\\!

It may be all my love went wrong --\\*
{\vin} A scribe's work writ awry and blurred,\\
Scrawled after the blind evensong --\\*
{\vin} Spoilt music with no perfect word.\\!

But surely I would fain have done\\*
{\vin} All things the best I could. Perchance\\
Because I failed, came short of one,\\*
{\vin} She kept at heart that other man's.\\!

I am grown blind with all these things:\\*
{\vin} It may be now she hath in sight\\
Some better knowledge; still there clings\\*
{\vin} The old question. Will not God do right?

Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,\\

Smiling they wrote his lie: aged 19 years.\\
Germans he scarcely thought of; all their guilt,\\

And soon, he was drafted out with drums \& cheers.\\!

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer, `Goal!'\\*
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits\\*
Th\'{a}nked him; and then enquired about his soul.\\!

Now, he will spend a few sick years in institutes,\\*
And do what things the rules consider wise,\\
And take whatever pity they may dole.\\
Tonight he noticed how the women's eyes\\
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.\\
How cold \& late it is. Why don't they come\\*
And put him into bed? Why don't they come?

Hold infinity in the palm of your hand\\

Puts all heaven in a rage.\\
A dove-house filled with doves \& pigeons\\
Shudders hell through all its regions.\\
A dog starved at his master's gate\\
Predicts the ruin of the state.\\
A horse misused upon the road\\
Calls to heaven for human blood.\\
A skylark wounded in the wing,\\
A cherubim does cease to sing.\\
The game cock clipped \& armed for fight\\
Does the rising sun affright.\\
Every wolf's \& lion's howl\\
Raises from hell a human soul.\\
The wild deer, wandering here \& there\\
Keeps the human soul from care.\\
The lamb misused breeds public strife\\
And yet forgives the butcher's knife.\\
The bat that flits at close of eve\\
Has left the brain that won't believe.\\
The owl that calls upon the night\\
Speaks the unbeliever's fright.\\
He who shall hurt the little wren\\
Shall never be beloved by men.\\
He who the ox to wrath has moved\\
Shall never be by woman loved.\\

Beats all the lies you can invent.\\

Palsied strikes the summer's sun.\\

Shall be mocked in age \& death.\\
He who shall teach the child to doubt\\
The rotting grave shall ne'er get out.\\
He who respects the infant's faith\\
Triumphs over hell \& death.\\
The child's toys \& the old man's reasons\\
Are the fruits of the two seasons.\\
The questioner who sits so sly\\
Shall never know how to reply.\\
He who replies to words of doubt\\
Doth put the light of knowledge out.\\
The strongest poison ever known\\
Came from caesar's laurel crown.\\
Nought can deform the human race\\
Like to the armour's iron brace.\\
When gold \& gems adorn the plough\\
To peaceful arts shall envy bow.\\
A riddle or the cricket's cry\\
Is to doubt a fit reply.\\
The emmet's inch \& eagle's mile\\
Make lame philosophy to smile.\\
He who doubts from what he sees\\
Will ne'er believe do what you please.\\

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part I} It is an ancient mariner\\*\footnotetext{`The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', Samuel Coleridge (1772 -- 1834), \cite{norton}. Coleridge kicks off his `Rime' with a lengthy quotation from a seventeenth century theologian, Thomas Burnet, and the original text is peppered with margin-notes throughout.}
{\vin} And he stoppeth one of three.\\
`By thy long grey beard \& glittering eye,\\*
{\vin} Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?\\!

`The bridegroom's doors are opened wide,\\*
{\vin} And I am next of kin;\\
The guests are met; the feast is set:\\*
{\vin} May'st hear the merry din.'\\!

He holds him with his skinny hand,\\*
{\vin} 'There was a ship,' quoth he.\\
'Hold off! Unhand me, grey-beard loon!'\\*
{\vin} Eftsoons his hand dropped he.\\!

He holds him with his glittering eye --\\*
{\vin} The wedding-guest stood still,\\
And listens like a three years' child:\\*
{\vin} The mariner hath his will.\\!

The wedding-guest sat on a stone:\\*
{\vin} He cannot choose but hear;\\
And thus spake on that ancient man,\\*
{\vin} The bright-eyed mariner.\\!

`The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,\\*
{\vin} Merrily did we drop\\
Below the kirk, below the hill,\\*
{\vin} Below the lighthouse-top.\\!

`The sun came up upon the left,\\*
{\vin} Out of the sea came he.\\
And he shone bright, and on the right\\*
{\vin} Went down into the sea.\\!

`Higher \& higher every day,\\*
{\vin} Till over the mast at noon --'\\
The wedding-guest here beat his breast,\\*
{\vin} For he heard the loud bassoon.\\!

`The bride hath paced into the hall,\\*
{\vin} Red as a rose is she;\\
Nodding their heads before her goes\\*
{\vin} The merry minstrelsy.\\!

`The wedding-guest he beat his breast,\\*
{\vin} Yet he cannot choose but hear;\\
And thus spake on that ancient man,\\*
{\vin} The bright-eyed mariner.\\!

`And now the storm-blast came, and he\\*
{\vin} Was tyrannous \& strong:\\
He struck with his o'ertaking wings,\\*
{\vin} And chased us south along.\\!

`With sloping masts \& dipping prow,\\*
As who pursued with yell \& blow\\
Still treads the shadow of his foe,\\
{\vin} And forward bends his head,\\
The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,\\*
{\vin} And southward aye we fled.\\!

`And now there came both mist \& snow,\\*
{\vin} And it grew wondrous cold:\\
And ice, mast-high, came floating by,\\*
{\vin} As green as emerald.\\!

`And through the drifts the snowy clifts\\*
{\vin} Did send a dismal sheen:\\
Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken --\\*
{\vin} The ice was all between.\\!

`The ice was here; the ice was there;\\*
{\vin} The ice was all around:\\
It cracked \& growled, and roared \& howled,\\*
{\vin} Like noises in a swound!\\!

`At length did cross an albatross,\\*
{\vin} Thorough the fog it came;\\
As if it had been a christian soul,\\*
{\vin} We hailed it in God's name.\\!

`It ate the food it ne'er had eat,\\*
{\vin} And round \& round it flew.\\
The ice did split with a thunder-fit;\\*
{\vin} The helmsman steered us through.\\!

`And a good south wind sprung up behind;\\*
{\vin} The albatross did follow,\\
And every day, for food or play,\\*
{\vin} Came to the mariner's hollo!\\!

`In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,\\*
{\vin} It perched for vespers nine;\\
Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,\\*
{\vin} Glimmered the white Moon-shine.'\\!

'God save thee, ancient Mariner!\\*
{\vin} From the fiends, that plague thee thus!\\
Why look'st thou so?' `With my cross-bow\\*
{\vin} I shot the albatross.\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part II} `The sun now rose upon the right:\\*
{\vin} Out of the sea came he,\\
Still hid in mist, and on the left\\*
{\vin} Went down into the sea.\\!

`And the good south wind still blew behind,\\*
{\vin} But no sweet bird did follow,\\
Nor any day for food or play\\*
{\vin} Came to the mariner's hollo.\\!

`And I had done a hellish thing,\\*
{\vin} And it would work 'em woe:\\
For all averred, I had killed the bird\\
{\vin} hat made the breeze to blow.\\
``Ah wretch!'' said they, ``The bird to slay,\\*
{\vin} That made the breeze to blow!''\\!

`Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,\\*
{\vin} The glorious sun uprist:\\
Then all averred, I had killed the bird\\
{\vin} That brought the fog and mist.\\
``'Twas right,'' said they, ``Such birds to slay,\\*
{\vin} That bring the fog \& mist.''\\!

`The fair breeze blew; the white foam flew;\\*
{\vin} The furrow followed free;\\
We were the first that ever burst\\*
{\vin} Into that silent sea.\\!

`Down dropped the breeze, the sails dropt down;\\*
{\vin} 'Twas sad as sad could be;\\
And we did speak only to break\\*
{\vin} The silence of the sea!\\!

`All in a hot \& copper sky,\\*
{\vin} The bloody sun, at noon,\\
Right up above the mast did stand,\\*
{\vin} No bigger than the moon.\\!

`Day after day, day after day,\\*
{\vin} We stuck, nor breath nor motion;\\
As idle as a painted ship\\*
{\vin} Upon a painted ocean.\\!

`Water, water, every where,\\*
{\vin} And all the boards did shrink;\\
Water, water, every where,\\*
{\vin} Nor any drop to drink.\\!

`The very deep did rot: O \textit{Christ}!\\*
{\vin} That ever this should be!\\
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs\\*
{\vin} Upon the slimy sea.\\!

`About, about, in reel \& rout\\*
{\vin} The death-fires danced at night;\\
The water, like a witch's oils,\\*
{\vin} Burnt green, and blue \& white.\\!

`And some in dreams assur\`{e}d were\\*
{\vin} Of the spirit that plagued us so;\\
Nine fathom deep he had followed us\\*
{\vin} From the land of mist \& snow.\\!

`And every tongue, through utter drought,\\*
{\vin} Was withered at the root;\\
We could not speak, no more than if\\*
{\vin} We had been choked with soot.\\!

`Ah well a-day what evil looks\\*
{\vin} Had I from old \& young!\\
Instead of the cross, the albatross\\*
{\vin} About my neck was hung.\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part III} `There passed a weary time. Each throat\\*
{\vin} Was parched, and glazed each eye.\\
A weary time! a weary time!\\
{\vin} How glazed each weary eye,\\
When looking westward, I beheld\\*
{\vin} A something in the sky.\\!

`At first it seemed a little speck,\\*
{\vin} And then it seemed a mist;\\
It moved \& moved, and took at last\\*
{\vin} A certain shape, I wist.\\!

`A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!\\*
{\vin} And still it neared \& neared:\\
As if it dodged a water-sprite,\\*
{\vin} It plunged \& tacked \& veered.\\!

`With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,\\*
{\vin} We could nor laugh nor wail;\\
Through utter drought all dumb we stood.\\
I bit my arm; I sucked the blood,\\*
{\vin} And cried, ``A sail! A sail!''\\!

`With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,\\*
{\vin} Agape they heard me call:\\
``Gramercy!'' they for joy did grin,\\
And all at once their breath drew in.\\*
{\vin} As they were drinking all.\\!

`{``}See! See!'' I cried. ``She tacks no more\\*
{\vin} Hither to work us weal;\\
Without a breeze, without a tide,\\*
{\vin} She steadies with upright keel!''\\!

`The western wave was all aflame.\\*
{\vin} The day was well nigh done.\\
Almost upon the western wave\\
{\vin} Rested the broad bright sun;\\
When that strange shape drove suddenly\\*
{\vin} Betwixt us and the sun.\\!

`And straight the sun was flecked with bars,\\*
{\vin} (Heaven's mother send us grace!)\\
As if through a dungeon-grate he peered\\*
{\vin} With broad \& burning face.\\!

`{``}Alas!'' thought I, and my heart beat loud,\\*
{\vin} ``How fast she nears \& nears!\\
Are those her sails that glance in the sun,\\*
{\vin} Like restless gossameres?\\!

`{``}Are those her ribs through which the sun\\*
{\vin} Did peer, as through a grate?\\
And is that woman all her crew?\\
Is that a death? and are there two?\\*
{\vin} Is death that woman's mate?''\\!

`Her lips were red; her looks were free;\\*
{\vin} Her locks were yellow as gold:\\
Her skin was as white as leprosy;\\
The nightmare life-in-death was she,\\*
{\vin} Who thicks man's blood with cold.\\!

`The naked hulk alongside came,\\*
{\vin} And the twain were casting dice;\\
``The game is done! I've won! I've won!''\\*
{\vin} Quoth she, and whistles thrice.\\!

`The sun's rim dips; the stars rush out;\\*
{\vin} At one stride comes the dark;\\
With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,\\*
{\vin} Off shot the spectre-bark.\\!

`We listened \& looked sideways up!\\*
Fear at my heart, as at a cup,\\
{\vin} My life-blood seemed to sip!\\
The stars were dim, and thick the night,\\
The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;\\
{\vin} From the sails the dew did drip --\\
Till clomb above the eastern bar\\
The horn\`{e}d moon, with one bright star\\*
{\vin} Within the nether tip.\\!

`One after one, by the star-dogged moon,\\*
{\vin} Too quick for groan or sigh,\\
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,\\*
{\vin} And cursed me with his eye.\\!

`Four times 50 living men,\\*
{\vin} (And I heard nor sigh nor groan)\\
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,\\*
{\vin} They dropped down one by one.\\!

`The souls did from their bodies fly --\\*
{\vin} They fled to bliss or woe!\\
And every soul, it passed me by,\\*
{\vin} Like the whizz of my cross-bow!'\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part IV}`I fear thee, ancient mariner!\\*
{\vin} I fear thy skinny hand!\\
And thou art long, \& lank, \& brown,\\*
{\vin} As is the ribbed sea-sand.\\!

`I fear thee and thy glittering eye,\\*
{\vin} And thy skinny hand, so brown.'\\
`Fear not, fear not, thou wedding-guest!\\*
{\vin} This body dropped not down.\\!

`Alone, alone, all, all alone,\\*
{\vin} Alone on a wide wide sea!\\
And never a saint took pity on\\*
{\vin} My soul in agony.\\!

`The many men, so beautiful!\\*
{\vin} And they all dead did lie:\\
And a 1000 1000 slimy things\\*
{\vin} Lived on; and so did I.\\!

`I looked upon the rotting sea,\\*
{\vin} And drew my eyes away;\\
I looked upon the rotting deck,\\*
{\vin} And there the dead men lay.\\!

`I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;\\*
{\vin} But or ever a prayer had gushed,\\
A wicked whisper came, and made\\*
{\vin} My heart as dry as dust.\\!

`I closed my lids, and kept them close,\\*
{\vin} And the balls like pulses beat;\\
For the sky \& the sea, and the sea \& the sky\\
Lay dead like a load on my weary eye,\\*
{\vin} And the dead were at my feet.\\!

`The cold sweat melted from their limbs,\\*
{\vin} Nor rot nor reek did they:\\
The look with which they looked on me\\*
{\vin} Had never passed away.\\!

`An orphan's curse would drag to hell\\*
{\vin} A spirit from on high;\\
But O more horrible than that\\
{\vin} Is the curse in a dead man's eye!\\
Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,\\*
{\vin} And yet I could not die.\\!

`The moving moon went up the sky,\\*
{\vin} And no where did abide:\\
Softly she was going up,\\*
{\vin} And a star or two beside --\\!

`Her beams bemocked the sultry main,\\*
{\vin} Like april hoar-frost spread;\\
But where the ship's huge shadow lay,\\
The charm\`{e}d water burnt alway\\*
{\vin} A still \& awful red.\\!

`Beyond the shadow of the ship,\\*
{\vin} I watched the water-snakes:\\
They moved in tracks of shining white,\\
And when they reared, the elfish light\\*
{\vin} Fell off in hoary flakes.\\!

`Within the shadow of the ship\\*
{\vin} I watched their rich attire:\\
Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,\\
They coiled \& swam; and every track\\*
{\vin} Was a flash of golden fire.\\!

`O happy living things, no tongue\\*
{\vin} Their beauty might declare:\\
A spring of love gushed from my heart,\\
{\vin} And I blessed them unaware:\\
Sure my kind saint took pity on me,\\*
{\vin} And I blessed them unaware.\\!

`The selfsame moment I could pray;\\*
{\vin} And from my neck so free\\
The albatross fell off, and sank\\*
{\vin} Like lead into the sea.\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part V}`O sleep, it is a gentle thing,\\*
{\vin} Beloved from pole to pole!\\
To \textit{Mary} Queen the praise be given!\\
She sent the gentle sleep from heaven,\\*
{\vin} That slid into my soul.\\!

`The silly buckets on the deck,\\*
{\vin} That had so long remained,\\
I dreamt that they were filled with dew;\\*
{\vin} And when I awoke, it rained.\\!

`My lips were wet; my throat was cold;\\*
{\vin} My garments all were dank;\\
Sure I had drunken in my dreams,\\*
{\vin} And still my body drank.\\!

`I moved, and could not feel my limbs:\\*
{\vin} I was so light -- almost\\
I thought that I had died in sleep,\\*
{\vin} And was a bless\`{e}d ghost.\\!

`And soon I heard a roaring wind:\\*
{\vin} It did not come anear;\\
But with its sound it shook the sails,\\*
{\vin} That were so thin \& sere.\\!

`The upper air burst into life!\\*
{\vin} And a 100 fire-flags sheen,\\
To \& fro they were hurried about!\\
And to \& fro, and in \& out,\\*
{\vin} The wan stars danced between.\\!

`And the coming wind did roar more loud,\\*
{\vin} And the sails did sigh like sedge,\\
And the rain poured down from one black cloud;\\*
{\vin} The moon was at its edge.\\!

`The thick black cloud was cleft, and still\\*
{\vin} The moon was at its side:\\
Like waters shot from some high crag,\\
The lightning fell with never a jag,\\*
{\vin} A river steep \& wide.\\!

`The loud wind never reached the ship,\\*
{\vin} Yet now the ship moved on!\\
Beneath the lightning and the moon\\*
{\vin} The dead men gave a groan.\\!

`They groaned; they stirred; they all uprose,\\*
{\vin} Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;\\
It had been strange, even in a dream,\\*
{\vin} To have seen those dead men rise.\\!

`The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;\\*
{\vin} Yet never a breeze up-blew;\\
The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,\\
{\vin} Where they were wont to do;\\
They raised their limbs like lifeless tools --\\*
{\vin} We were a ghastly crew.\\!

`The body of my brother's son\\*
{\vin} Stood by me, knee to knee:\\
The body \& I pulled at one rope,\\*
{\vin} But he said nought to me.'\\!

`I fear thee, ancient mariner!'\\*
{\vin} `Be calm, thou wedding-guest!\\
'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,\\
Which to their corses came again,\\*
{\vin} But a troop of spirits blest:\\!

`For when it dawned -- they dropped their arms,\\*
{\vin} And clustered round the mast;\\
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,\\*
{\vin} And from their bodies passed.\\!

`Around, around, flew each sweet sound,\\*
{\vin} Then darted to the sun;\\
Slowly the sounds came back again,\\*
{\vin} Now mixed, now one by one.\\!

`Sometimes a-dropping from the sky\\*
{\vin} I heard the sky-lark sing;\\
Sometimes all little birds that are,\\
How they seemed to fill the sea and air\\*
{\vin} With their sweet jargoning!\\!

`And now 'twas like all instruments,\\*
{\vin} Now like a lonely flute;\\
And now it is an angel's song,\\*
{\vin} That makes the heavens be mute.\\!

`It ceased; yet still the sails made on\\*
{\vin} A pleasant noise till noon,\\
A noise like of a hidden brook\\
{\vin} In the leafy month of june,\\
That to the sleeping woods all night\\*
{\vin} Singeth a quiet tune.\\!

`Till noon we quietly sailed on,\\*
{\vin} Yet never a breeze did breathe:\\
Slowly \& smoothly went the ship,\\*
{\vin} Moved onward from beneath.\\!

`Under the keel nine fathom deep,\\*
{\vin} From the land of mist \& snow,\\
The spirit slid: and it was he\\
{\vin} That made the ship to go.\\
The sails at noon left off their tune,\\*
{\vin} And the ship stood still also.\\!

`The sun, right up above the mast,\\*
{\vin} Had fixed her to the ocean:\\
But in a minute she 'gan stir,\\
{\vin} With a short uneasy motion --\\
Backwards \& forwards \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} her length\\*
{\vin} With a short uneasy motion.\\!

`Then like a pawing horse let go,\\*
{\vin} She made a sudden bound:\\
It flung the blood into my head,\\*
{\vin} And I fell down in a swound.\\!

`How long in that same fit I lay,\\*
{\vin} I have not to declare;\\
But ere my living life returned,\\
I heard and in my soul discerned\\*
{\vin} Two voices in the air.\\!

`{``}Is it he?'' quoth one, ``Is this the man?\\*
{\vin} By him who died on cross,\\
With his cruel bow he laid full low\\*
{\vin} The harmless albatross.\\!

`{``}The spirit who bideth by himself\\*
{\vin} In the land of mist \& snow,\\
He loved the bird that loved the man\\*
{\vin} Who shot him with his bow.''\\!

`The other was a softer voice,\\*
{\vin} As soft as honey-dew:\\
Quoth he, ``The man hath penance done,\\*
{\vin} And penance more will do.''\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part VI}`{``}But tell me! Tell me! Speak again,\\*
\flagverse{\footnotesize First Voice}{\vin} Thy soft response renewing --\\
What makes that ship drive on so fast?\\*
{\vin} What is the ocean doing?''\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Second Voice}`{``}Still as a slave before his lord,\\*
{\vin} The ocean hath no blast;\\
His great bright eye most silently\\*
{\vin} Up to the moon is cast --\\!

`{``}If he may know which way to go;\\*
{\vin} For she guides him smooth or grim.\\
See, brother, see! how graciously\\*
{\vin} She looketh down on him.''\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize First Voice}`{``}But why drives on that ship so fast,\\*
{\vin} Without or wave or wind?''\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Second Voice}`{``}The air is cut away before,\\*
{\vin} And closes from behind.\\!

`{``}Fly, brother, fly! More high, more high!\\*
{\vin} Or we shall be belated:\\
For slow \& slow that ship will go,\\*
{\vin} When the mariner's trance is abated.''\\!

`I woke, and we were sailing on\\*
{\vin} As in a gentle weather:\\
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;\\*
{\vin} The dead men stood together.\\!

`All stood together on the deck,\\*
{\vin} For a charnel-dungeon fitter:\\
All fixed on me their stony eyes,\\*
{\vin} That in the moon did glitter.\\!

`The pang, the curse, with which they died,\\*
{\vin} Had never passed away:\\
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,\\*
{\vin} Nor turn them up to pray.\\!

`And now this spell was snapped: once more\\*
{\vin} I viewed the ocean green,\\
And looked far forth, yet little saw\\*
{\vin} Of what had else been seen --\\!

`Like one, that on a lonesome road\\*
{\vin} Doth walk in fear \& dread,\\
And having once turned round walks on,\\
{\vin} And turns no more his head;\\
Because he knows, a frightful fiend\\*
{\vin} Doth close behind him tread.\\!

`But soon there breathed a wind on me,\\*
{\vin} Nor sound nor motion made:\\
Its path was not upon the sea,\\*
{\vin} In ripple or in shade.\\!

`It raised my hair; it fanned my cheek\\*
{\vin} Like a meadow-gale of spring --\\
It mingled strangely with my fears,\\*
{\vin} Yet it felt like a welcoming.\\!

`Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,\\*
{\vin} Yet she sailed softly too:\\
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze --\\*
{\vin} On me alone it blew.\\!

`O dream of joy, is this indeed\\*
{\vin} The light-house top I see?\\
Is this the hill? Is this the kirk?\\*
{\vin} Is this mine own country?\\!

`We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,\\*
{\vin} And I with sobs did pray --\\
``O let me be awake, my God!\\*
{\vin} Or let me sleep alway.''\\!

`The harbour-bay was clear as glass,\\*
{\vin} So smoothly it was strewn.\\
And on the bay the moonlight lay,\\*
{\vin} And the shadow of the moon.\\!

`The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,\\*
{\vin} That stands above the rock:\\
The moonlight steeped in silentness\\*
{\vin} The steady weathercock.\\!

`And the bay was white with silent light,\\*
{\vin} Till rising from the same,\\
Full many shapes, that shadows were,\\*
{\vin} In crimson colours came.\\!

`A little distance from the prow\\*
{\vin} Those crimson shadows were:\\
I turned my eyes upon the deck --\\*
{\vin} O \textit{Christ}! What saw I there!\\!

`Each corse lay flat, lifeless \& flat,\\*
{\vin} And, by the holy rood!\\
A man all light, a seraph-man,\\*
{\vin} On every corse there stood.\\!

`This seraph-band, each waved his hand:\\*
{\vin} It was a heavenly sight!\\
They stood as signals to the land,\\*
{\vin} Each one a lovely light;\\!

`This seraph-band, each waved his hand,\\*
{\vin} No voice did they impart --\\
No voice; but O the silence sank\\*
{\vin} Like music on my heart.\\!

`But soon I heard the dash of oars,\\*
{\vin} I heard the pilot's cheer;\\
My head was turned perforce away\\*
{\vin} And I saw a boat appear.\\!

`The pilot \& the pilot's boy,\\*
{\vin} I heard them coming fast:\\
Dear Lord in Hhaven! it was a joy\\*
{\vin} The dead men could not blast.\\!

`I saw a third -- I heard his voice:\\*
{\vin} It is the hermit good!\\
He singeth loud his godly hymns\\
{\vin} That he makes in the wood.\\
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away\\*
{\vin} The albatross's blood.\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part VII}`This hermit good lives in that wood\\*
{\vin} Which slopes down to the sea.\\
How loudly his sweet voice he rears!\\
He loves to talk with marineres\\*
{\vin} That come from a far country.\\!

`He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve --\\*
{\vin} He hath a cushion plump:\\
It is the moss that wholly hides\\*
{\vin} The rotted old oak-stump.\\!

`The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,\\*
{\vin} ``Why, this is strange, I trow!\\
Where are those lights so many \& fair,\\*
{\vin} That signal made but now?''\\!

`{``}Strange, by my faith!'' the hermit said,\\*
{\vin} ``And they answered not our cheer!\\
The planks looked warped! And see those sails,\\
{\vin} How thin they are \& sere!\\
I never saw aught like to them,\\*
{\vin} Unless perchance it were\\!

`{``}Brown skeletons of leaves that lag\\*
{\vin} My forest-brook along;\\
When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,\\
And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,\\*
{\vin} That eats the she-wolf's young.''\\!

`{``}Dear Lord, it hath a fiendish look --''\\*
{\vin} The pilot made reply,\\
``I am afeared.'' ``Push on! Push on!''\\*
{\vin} Said the hermit cheerily.\\!

`The boat came closer to the ship,\\*
{\vin} But I nor spake nor stirred;\\
The boat came close beneath the ship,\\*
{\vin} And straight a sound was heard.\\!

`Under the water it rumbled on,\\*
{\vin} Still louder \& more dread:\\
It reached the ship; it split the bay;\\*
{\vin} The ship went down like lead.\\!

`Stunned by that loud \& dreadful sound,\\*
{\vin} Which sky \& ocean smote,\\
Like one that hath been seven days drowned\\
{\vin} My body lay afloat;\\
But swift as dreams, myself I found\\*
{\vin} Within the pilot's boat.\\!

`Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,\\*
{\vin} The boat spun round \& round;\\
And all was still, save that the hill\\*
{\vin} Was telling of the sound.\\!

`I moved my lips -- the pilot shrieked\\*
{\vin} And fell down in a fit;\\
The holy hermit raised his eyes,\\*
{\vin} And prayed where he did sit.\\!

`I took the oars: the pilot's boy,\\*
{\vin} Who now doth crazy go,\\
Laughed loud \& long, and all the while\\
{\vin} His eyes went to \& fro.\\
``Ha ha!'' quoth he, ``Full plain I see,\\*
{\vin} The devil knows how to row.''\\!

`And now, all in my own country,\\*
{\vin} I stood on the firm land.\\
The hermit stepped forth from the boat,\\*
{\vin} And scarcely he could stand.\\!

`{``}O shrieve me! Shrieve me, holy man!''\\*
{\vin} The hermit crossed his brow.\\
``Say quick,' quoth he, ``I bid thee say --\\*
{\vin} What manner of man art thou?''\\!

`Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched\\*
{\vin} With a woeful agony,\\
Which forced me to begin my tale;\\*
{\vin} And then it left me free.\\!

`Since then, at an uncertain hour,\\*
{\vin} That agony returns:\\
And till my ghastly tale is told,\\*
{\vin} This heart within me burns.\\!

`I pass, like night, from land to land;\\*
{\vin} I have strange power of speech;\\
That moment that his face I see,\\
I know the man that must hear me:\\*
{\vin} To him my tale I teach.\\!

`What loud uproar bursts from that door!\\*
{\vin} The wedding-guests are there:\\
But in the garden-bower the bride\\
{\vin} And bride-maids singing are:\\
And hark the little vesper bell,\\*
{\vin} Which biddeth me to prayer!\\!

`O wedding-guest, this soul hath been\\*
{\vin} Alone on a wide wide sea:\\
So lonely 'twas, that God himself\\*
{\vin} Scarce seem\`{e}d there to be.\\!

`O sweeter than the marriage-feast,\\*
{\vin} 'Tis sweeter far to me,\\
To walk together to the kirk\\*
{\vin} With a goodly company!\\!

`To walk together to the kirk,\\*
{\vin} And all together pray,\\
While each to his great Father bends,\\
Old men, and babes, and loving friends\\*
{\vin} And youths \& maidens gay!\\!

`Farewell, farewell! But this I tell\\*
{\vin} To thee, thou wedding-guest!\\
He prayeth well, who loveth well\\*
{\vin} Both man \& bird \& beast.\\!

`He prayeth best, who loveth best\\*
{\vin} All things both great \& small;\\
For the dear God who loveth us,\\*
{\vin} He made \& loveth all.'\\!

The mariner, whose eye is bright,\\*
{\vin} Whose beard with age is hoar,\\
Is gone: and now the wedding-guest\\*
{\vin} Turned from the bridegroom's door.\\!

He went like one that hath been stunned,\\*
{\vin} And is of sense forlorn:\\
A sadder \& a wiser man,\\*
{\vin} He rose the morrow morn.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The frost performs its secret ministry,\\*\footnotetext{`Frost at Midnight', Samuel Coleridge (1772 -- 1834), \cite{norton}. In folklore, the flakes of ash floating up the flue were said to predict the arrival of strangers, and thus Coleridge refers to them as such.}
Unhelped by any wind. The owlet's cry\\
Came loud -- and hark, again, loud as before.\\
The inmates of my cottage, all at rest,\\
Have left me to that solitude, which suits\\
Abstruser musings: save that at my side\\
My cradled infant slumbers peacefully.\\
'Tis calm indeed, so calm that it disturbs\\
And vexes meditation with its strange\\
And extreme silentness. Sea, hill, \& wood,\\
This populous village! Sea, \& hill, \& wood,\\
With all the numberless goings-on of life,\\
Inaudible as dreams! The thin blue flame\\
Lies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not;\\
Only that film, which fluttered on the grate,\\
Still flutters there, the sole unquiet thing.\\
Methinks, its motion in this hush of nature\\
Gives it dim sympathies with me who live,\\
Making it a companionable form,\\
Whose puny flaps \& freaks the idling spirit\\
By its own moods interprets, everywhere\\
Echo or mirror seeking of itself,\\*
And makes a toy of thought.\\!

\textcolor{white}{And makes a toy of thought.} But O how oft,\\*
How oft, at school, with most believing mind,\\
Presageful, have I gazed upon the bars,\\
To watch that fluttering str\'{a}nger, and as oft\\
With unclosed lids, already had I dreamt\\
Of my sweet birth-place, and the old church-tower,\\
Whose bells, the poor man's only music, rang\\
From morn to evening, all the hot fair-day,\\
So sweetly, that they stirred \& haunted me\\
With a wild pleasure, falling on mine ear\\
Most like articulate sounds of things to come.\\
So gazed I, till the soothing things, I dreamt,\\
Lulled me to sleep, and sleep prolonged my dreams.\\
And so I brooded all the following morn,\\
Awed by the stern preceptor's face, mine eye\\
Fixed with mock study on my swimming book:\\
Save if the door half opened, and I snatched\\
A hasty glance, and still my heart leaped up,\\
For still I hoped to see the str\'{a}nger's face,\\
Townsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved,\\*
My play-mate when we both were clothed alike.\\!

Dear babe, that sleepest cradled by my side,\\*
Whose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm,\\
Fill up the intersperséd vacancies\\
And momentary pauses of the thought.\\
My babe so beautiful, it thrills my heart\\
With tender gladness, thus to look at thee,\\
And think that thou shalt learn far other lore,\\
And in far other scenes. For I was reared\\
In the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim,\\
And saw nought lovely but the sky \& stars.\\
But th\'{o}u, my babe, shalt wander like a breeze\\
By lakes \& sandy shores, beneath the crags\\
Of ancient mountain, and beneath the clouds,\\
Which image in their bulk both lakes \& shores\\
And mountain crags: so shalt thou see \& hear\\
The lovely shapes \& sounds intelligible\\
Of that eternal language, which thy God\\
Utters, who from eternity doth teach\\
Himself in all, and all things in himself.\\
Great universal Teacher, he shall mould\\*
Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask.\\!

Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee,\\*
Whether the summer clothe the general earth\\
With greenness, or the redbreast sit \& sing\\
Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch\\
Of mossy apple-tree, while the night-thatch\\
Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall\\
Heard only in the trances of the blast,\\
Or if the secret ministry of frost\\
Shall hang them up in silent icicles,\\*
Quietly shining to the quiet moon.

Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may\\
Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,\\
But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone\\
As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green\\
Water; and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen\\
Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,\\*
Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.

Common sense.\\!

If you cannot engender\\*
A genius like \textit{Mozart},\\*
Neither can you\\!

Plague the earth\\*
With brilliant sillies like \textit{Hegel}\\*
Or clever nasties like \textit{Hobbes}.\\!

Shall we ever become adulted,\\*
As you all soon do?\\*
It seems unlikely.\\!

Indeed, one balmy day,\\*
We might all become\\*
Not fossils, but vapour.\\!

Distinct now,\\*
In the end we shall join you\\*

But you exhibit no signs\\*
Of knowing that you are sentenced.\\*
Now, could that be why\\!

We upstarts are often\\*
Jealous of your innocence,\\*
But never envious.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
If it form the landscape that we, the inconstant ones,\\*\footnotetext{`In Praise of Limestone', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973), \cite{audena}.}
{\vin} Are constantly homesick for, this is chiefly\\
Because it dissolves in water. Mark these rounded slopes\\
{\vin} With their surface fragrance of thyme and, beneath,\\
A secret system of caves \& conduits; hear the springs\\
{\vin} That spurt out everywhere with a chuckle,\\
Each filling a private pool for its fish and carving\\
{\vin} Its own little ravine whose cliffs entertain\\
The butterfly \& the lizard; examine this region\\
{\vin} Of short distances \& definite places:\\
What could be more like mother or a fitter background\\
{\vin} For her son, the flirtatious male who lounges\\
Against a rock in the sunlight, never doubting\\
{\vin} That for all his faults he is loved; whose works are but\\
Extensions of his power to charm? From weathered outcrop\\
{\vin} To hill-top temple, from appearing waters to\\
Conspicuous fountains, from a wild to a formal vineyard,\\
{\vin} Are ingenious but short steps that a child's wish\\
To receive more attention than his brothers, whether\\*
{\vin} By pleasing or teasing, can easily take.\\!

Watch, then, the band of rivals as they climb up \& down\\*
{\vin} The steep stone gennels in twos \& threes, at times\\
Arm in arm, but never, thank God, in step; or engaged\\
{\vin} On a shady side of a square at midday in\\
Voluble discourse, knowing each other too well to think\\
{\vin} There are any important secrets, unable\\
To conceive a god whose temper-tantrums are moral\\
{\vin} And not to be pacified by a clever line\\
Or a good lay: for, accustomed to a stone that responds,\\
{\vin} They have never had to veil their faces in awe\\
Of a crater whose blazing fury could not be fixed;\\
{\vin} Adjusted to the local needs of valleys\\
Where everything can be touched or reached by walking,\\
{\vin} Their eyes have never looked into infinite space\\
Through the lattice-work of a nomad's comb; born lucky,\\
{\vin} Their legs have never encountered the fungi\\
And insects of the jungle, the monstrous forms \& lives\\
{\vin} With which we have nothing, we like to think, in common.\\
So, when one of them goes to the bad, the way his mind works\\
{\vin} Remains comprehensible: to become a pimp\\
Or deal in fake jewellery or ruin a fine tenor voice\\
{\vin} For effects that bring down the house, could happen to all\\
But the best \& the worst of us... That is why, I suppose,\\
{\vin} The best \& worst never stayed here long but sought\\
Immoderate soils where the beauty was not so external,\\
{\vin} The light less public and the meaning of life\\
Something more than a mad camp. `Come!' cried the granite wastes,\\
{\vin} `How evasive is your humour, how accidental\\
Your kindest kiss, how permanent is death.' (Saints-to-be\\
{\vin} Slipped away sighing.) `Come!' purred the clays \& gravels,\\
`On our plains there is room for armies to drill; rivers\\
{\vin} Wait to be tamed and slaves to construct you a tomb\\
In the grand manner: soft as the earth is mankind and both\\
{\vin} Need to be altered.' (Intendant Caesars rose and\\
Left, slamming the door.) But the really reckless were fetched\\
{\vin} By an older colder voice, the oceanic whisper:\\
`I am the solitude that asks \& promises nothing;\\
{\vin} That is how I shall set you free. There is no love;\\*
There are only the various envies, all of them sad.\\!

{\vin} They were right, my dear; all those voices were right\\*
And still are; this land is not the sweet home that it looks,\\
{\vin} Nor its peace the historical calm of a site\\
Where something was settled once \& for all: a backward\\
{\vin} And dilapidated province, connected\\
To the big busy world by a tunnel, with a certain\\
{\vin} Seedy appeal, is that all it is now? Not quite:\\
It has a worldly duty which in spite of itself\\
{\vin} It does not neglect, but calls into question\\
All the great powers assume; it disturbs our rights. The poet,\\
{\vin} Admired for his earnest habit of calling\\
The sun the sun, his mind puzzle, is made uneasy\\
{\vin} By these marble statues which so obviously doubt\\
His anti-mythological myth; and these gamins,\\
{\vin} Pursuing the scientist down the tiled colonnade\\
With such lively offers, rebuke his concern for nature's\\
{\vin} Remotest aspects: I, too, am reproached, for what\\
And how much you know. Not to lose time, not to get caught,\\
{\vin} Not to be left behind, not -- please! -- to resemble\\
The beasts who repeat themselves or a thing like water\\
{\vin} Or stone whose conduct can be predicted, these\\
Are our {\hoskeroe Common Prayer}, whose greatest comfort is music\\
{\vin} Which can be made anywhere, is invisible,\\
And does not smell. In so far as we have to look forward\\
{\vin} To death as a fact, no doubt we are right: but if\\
Sins can be forgiven, if bodies rise from the dead,\\
{\vin} These modifications of matter into\\
Innocent athletes \& gesticulating fountains,\\
{\vin} Made solely for pleasure, make a further point:\\
The bless\`{e}d will not care what angle they are regarded from,\\
{\vin} Having nothing to hide. Dear, I know nothing of\\
Either, but when I try to imagine a faultless love\\
{\vin} Or the life to come, what I hear is the murmur\\*
Of underground streams, what I see is a limestone landscape.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Taller today, we remember similar evenings, evenings,\\*\footnotetext{`Taller Today', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973), \cite{audena}. The text here follows that of the earliest published version. In later editions, Auden excised the second and third verses.}
Walking together in the windless orchard\\*
Where the brook runs over the gravel, far from the glacier.\\!

Again in the room with the sofa hiding the grate,\\*
Look down to the river when the rain is over,\\
See him turn to the window, hearing our last\\*
Of Captain \textit{Ferguson}.\\!

It is seen how excellent hands have turned to commonness.\\*
One staring too long, went blind in a tower,\\*
One sold all his manors to fight, broke through, and faltered.\\!

Nights come bringing the snow, and the dead howl\\*
Under the headlands in their windy dwelling\\
Because the Adversary put too easy questions\\*
On lonely roads\\!

But happy now, though no nearer each other,\\*
We see the farms lighted all along the valley;\\
Down at the mill-shed the hammering stops\\*
And men go home.\\!

Noises at dawn will bring\\*
Freedom for some, but not this peace\\
No bird can contradict: passing, but is sufficient now\\*
For something fulfilled this hour, loved or endured.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The piers are pummelled by the waves;\\*\footnotetext{`The Fall of Rome', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973), \cite{audena}. Prof Auden dedicated the poem to Cyril Connolly. Each verse seems to consider a reason frequently given by historians for the collapse of the Roman Empire. In particular, the last verse concerns the following theory: changes in the climate forced the migration of certain species (amongst them, reindeer) on the steppes of Eastern Europe, which in turn forced the migration of those tribes which depended on said species. This led to a chain of tribal migrations, culminating in the barbarian invasions of Late Antiquity which brought about the Empire's demise.}
In a lonely field the rain\\
Lashes an abandoned train;\\*
Outlaws fill the mountain caves.\\!

Fantastic grow the evening gowns;\\*
Agents of the Fisc pursue\\
Absconding tax-defaulters through\\*
The sewers of provincial towns.\\!

Private rites of magic send\\*
The temple prostitutes to sleep;\\
All the literati keep\\*
An imaginary friend.\\!

Cerebrotonic \textit{Cato} may\\*
Extol the ancient disciplines,\\
But the muscle-bound marines\\*
Mutiny for food \& pay.\\!

Caesar's double bed is warm\\*
While an unimportant clerk\\
Writes, `I do not like my work,'\\*
On a pink official form.\\!

Unendowed with wealth or pity,\\*
Little birds with scarlet legs,\\
Sitting on their speckled eggs,\\*
Eye each flu-infected city.\\!

Altogether elsewhere, vast\\*
Herds of reindeer move across\\
Miles \& miles of golden moss,\\*
Silently and very fast.

No fields but are his own.

Who stands, the crux left of the watershed,\\*\footnotetext{`The Watershed', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973), \cite{audenb}.}
On the wet road between the chafing grass\\
Below him sees dismantled washing-floors,\\
Snatches of tramline running to a wood,\\
An industry already comatose,\\
Yet sparsely living. A ramshackle engine\\
At \textsc{Cashwell} raises water; for 10 years\\
It lay in flooded workings until this,\\
Its latter office, grudgingly performed.\\
And, further, here and there, though many dead\\
Lie under the poor soil, some acts are chosen,\\
Taken from recent winters; two there were\\
Cleaned out a damaged shaft by hand, clutching\\
The winch a gale would tear them from; one died\\
During a storm, the fells impassable,\\
Not at his village, but in wooden shape\\
Through long abandoned levels nosed his way\\*
And in his final valley went to ground.\\!

Go home, now, stranger, proud of your young stock,\\*
Stranger, turn back again, frustrate \& vexed:\\
This land, cut off, will not communicate,\\
Be no accessory content to one\\
Aimless for faces rather there than here.\\
Beams from your car may cross a bedroom wall,\\
They wake no sleeper; you may hear the wind\\
Arriving driven from the ignorant sea\\
To hurt itself on pane, on bark of elm\\
Where sap unbaffled rises, being spring;\\
But seldom this. Near you, taller than the grass,\\*
Ears poise before decision, scenting danger.

Since you are going to begin today\\*\footnotetext{`Venus Will Now Say a Few Words', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973), \cite{audenb}.}
Let us consider what it is you do.\\
You are the one whose part it is to lean,\\
For whom it is not good to be alone.\\
Laugh warmly turning shyly in the hall\\
Or climb with bare knees the volcanic hill,\\
Acquire that flick of wrist and after strain\\
Relax in your darling’s arms like a stone,\\
Remembering everything you can confess,\\
Making the most of firelight, of hours and fuss;\\
But joy is mine not yours -- to have come so far,\\
Whose cleverest invention was lately fur;\\
Lizards my best once who took years to breed,\\
Could not control the temperature of blood.\\
To reach that shape for your face to assume,\\
Pleasure to many and despair to some,\\
I shifted ranges, lived epochs handicapped\\
By climate, wars, or what the young men kept,\\
Modified theories on the types of dross,\\
Altered desire and history of dress.\\
You in the town now call the exile fool\\
That writes home once a year as last leaves fall,\\
Think -- romans had a language in their day\\
And ordered roads with it, but it had to die:\\
Your culture can but leave -- forgot as sure\\
As place-name origins in favorite shire --\\
Jottings for stories, some often-mentioned \textit{Jack},\\
And references in letters to a private joke,\\
Equipment rusting in unweeded lanes,\\
Virtues still advertised on local lines;\\
And your conviction shall help none to fly,\\*
Cause rather a perversion on next floor.\\!

Nor even in despair your own, when swiftly\\*
Comes general assault on your ideas of safety:\\
That sense of famine, central anguish felt\\
For goodness wasted at peripheral fault,\\
Your shutting up the house and taking prow\\
To go into the wilderness to pray,\\
Means that I wish to leave and to pass on,\\
Select another form, perhaps your son;\\
Though he reject you, join opposing team\\
Be late or early at another time,\\
My treatment will not differ -- he will be tipped,\\
Found weeping, signed for, made to answer, topped.\\
Do not imagine you can abdicate;\\
Before you reach the frontier you are caught;\\
Others have tried it and will try again\\
To finish that which they did not begin:\\
Their fate must always be the same as yours,\\
To suffer the loss they were afraid of, yes,\\*
Holders of one position, wrong for years.

Conformity with the orthodox bone,\\!

With organised fear, the articulated skeleton.\\*
You whom I gladly walk with, touch,\\

We know it, we know that love\\
Needs more than the admiring excitement of union,\\
More than the abrupt self-confident farewell,\\
The heel on the finishing blade of grass,\\
The self-confidence of the falling root,\\
Needs death, death of the grain, our death.\\
Death of the old gang; would leave them\\
In sullen valley where is made no friend,\\

Stiff underground; deep in clear lake\\*

The clouds rift suddenly -- look there\\
At cigarette-end smouldering on a border\\
At the first garden party of the year.\\
Pass on, admire the view of the massif\\
Through plate-glass windows of the \textsc{Sport Hotel};\\
Join there the insufficient units\\
Dangerous, easy, in furs, in uniform\\
And constellated at reserved tables\\
Supplied with feelings by an efficient band\\
Relayed elsewhere to farmers and their dogs\\*
Sitting in kitchens in the stormy fens.\\!

Long ago, supreme antagonist,\\*
More powerful than the great northern whale\\
Ancient and sorry at life's limiting defect,\\
In Cornwall, Mendip, or the Pennine moor\\

Found they no answer, made them wish to die\\
- Lie since in barrows out of harm.\\
You talk to your admirers every day\\
By silted harbours, derelict works,\\
In strangled orchard, and the silent comb\\
Where dogs have worried or a bird was shot.\\

Visit the ports and, interrupting\\
The leisurely conversation in the bar\\
Within a stone's throw of the sunlit water,\\
Beckon your chosen out. Summon\\
Those handsome and diseased youngsters, those women\\
Your solitary agents in the country parishes;\\
And mobilise the powerful forces latent\\
In soils that make the farmer brutal\\
In the infected sinus, and the eyes of stoats.\\
Then, ready, start your rumour, soft\\
But horrifying in its capacity to disgust\\
Which, spreading magnified, shall come to be\\
A polar peril, a prodigious alarm,\\
Scattering the people, as torn up paper\\
Rags and utensils in a sudden gust,\\*
Seized with immeasurable neurotic dread.\\!

Seekers after happiness, all who follow\\*
The convolutions of your simple wish,\\
It is later than you think; nearer that day\\
Far other than that distant afternoon\\
Amid rustle of frocks and stamping feet\\
They gave the prizes to the ruined boys.\\
You cannot be away, then, no\\
Not though you pack to leave within an hour,\\
Escaping humming down arterial roads:\\
The date was yours; the prey to fugues,\\
Irregular breathing and alternate ascendancies\\
After some haunted migratory years\\
To disintegrate on an instant in the explosion of mania\\*
Or lapse forever into a classic fatigue.

Hearing of harvests rotting in the valleys,\\*\footnotetext{`Paysage Moralis\'e', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973), \cite{audenb}. According to an article by one Harry Eyres, published in the \textit{Financial Times} in 2012: `The art historian Erwin Panofsky coined the phrase paysage moralis\'e to describe the kind of renaissance painting in which aspects of landscape have moral significance. The example he took was Piero di Cosimo's \textit{The Discovery of Honey by Bacchus}, ``where the antithesis between Virtue and Pleasure is symbolised by the contrast between an easy road winding through beautiful country and a steep stony path leading up to a forbidding rock''. Panofsky was apparently rather chuffed that his coinage provided W. H. Auden with the title for one of his most anthologised poems'.}
Seeing at end of street the barren mountains,\\
Round corners coming suddenly on water,\\
Knowing them shipwrecked who were launched for islands,\\
We honour founders of these starving cities\\*
Whose honour is the image of our sorrow,\\!

Which cannot see its likeness in their sorrow\\*
That brought them desperate to the brink of valleys;\\
Dreaming of evening walks through learned cities\\
They reined their violent horses on the mountains,\\
Those fields like ships to castaways on islands,\\*
Visions of green to them who craved for water.\\!

They built by rivers and at night the water\\*
Running past windows comforted their sorrow;\\
Each in his little bed conceived of islands\\
Where every day was dancing in the valleys\\
And all the green trees blossomed on the mountains\\*
Where love was innocent, being far from cities.\\!

But dawn came back and they were still in cities;\\*
No marvellous creature rose up from the water;\\
There was still gold \& silver in the mountains\\
But hunger was a more immediate sorrow,\\
Although to moping villagers in valleys\\*
Some waving pilgrims were describing islands...\\!

`The gods,' they promised, `visit us from islands,\\*
Are stalking, head-up, lovely, through our cities;\\
Now is the time to leave your wretched valleys\\
And sail with them across the lime-green water,\\
Sitting at their white sides, forget your sorrow,\\*
The shadow cast across your lives by mountains.'\\!

So many, doubtful, perished in the mountains,\\*
Climbing up crags to get a view of islands;\\
So many, fearful, took with them their sorrow\\
Which stayed them when they reached unhappy cities;\\
So many, careless, dived \& drowned in water;\\*
So many, wretched, would not leave their valleys.\\!

It is our sorrow. Shall it melt? Ah water\\*
Would gush, flush, green these mountains \& these valleys,\\*
And we rebuild our cities, not dream of islands.

Burn for a new imprudent year;\\
The silence buzzes in my ear;\\*
The lights of near-by families are out.\\!

Under the darkness nothing seems to stir;\\*
The lilac bush like a conspirator\\
Shams dead upon the lawn, and there\\
Above the flagstaff the great bear\\*
Hangs as a portent over \textsc{Helensburgh}.\\!

O lords of limit, training dark \& light\\*
And setting a taboo 'twixt left \& right,\\
The influential quiet twins\\
From whom all property begins,\\*
Look leniently upon us all to-night.\\!

No one has seen you: none can say, `Of late --\\*
Here. You can see the marks. They lay in wait,'\\
But in my thoughts to-night you seem\\
Forms which I saw once in a dream,\\*
The stocky keepers of a wild estate.\\!

With guns beneath your arms, in sun \& wet,\\*
At doorways posted or on ridges set,\\
By cope or bridge we know you there\\
Whose sleepless presences endear\\*
Our peace to us with a perpetual threat.\\!

Look not too closely, be not over-quick;\\*
We have no invitation, but we are sick,\\
Using the mole's device, the carriage\\
Of peacock or rat's desperate courage,\\*
And we shall only pass you by a trick.\\!

Deeper towards the summer the year moves on.\\*
What if the starving visionary have seen\\
The carnival within our gates,\\
Your bodies kicked about the streets,\\*
We need your power still: use it, that none,\\!

O, from their tables break uncontrollably away,\\*
Lunging, insensible to injury,\\
Dangerous in a room or out wild-\\
-ly spinning like a top in the field,\\*
Mopping \& mowing through the sleepless day.

{\vin} Walking down \textsc{Bristol Street},\\
The crowds upon the pavement\\*
{\vin} Were fields of harvest wheat.\\!

And down by the brimming river\\*
{\vin} I heard a lover sing\\
Under an arch of the railway:\\*
{\vin} `Love has no ending.\\!

`I'll love you, dear, I'll love you\\*
{\vin} Till China \& Africa meet,\\
And the river jumps over the mountain\\*
{\vin} And the salmon sing in the street;\\!

{\vin} Like geese about the sky.\\!

`The years shall run like rabbits,\\*
{\vin} For in my arms I hold\\
The flower of the ages,\\*
{\vin} And the first love of the world.'\\!

But all the clocks in the city\\*
{\vin} Began to whirr \& chime:\\
`O let not time deceive you;\\*
{\vin} You cannot conquer time.\\!

`In the burrows of the nightmare\\*

{\vin} And coughs when you would kiss.\\!

And time will have his fancy\\*
{\vin} To-morrow or to-day.\\!

`Into many a green valley\\*
{\vin} Drifts the appalling snow;\\
Time breaks the threaded dances\\*
{\vin} And the diver's brilliant bow.\\!

`O plunge your hands in water,\\*
{\vin} Plunge them in up to the wrist;\\
Stare, stare in the basin\\*

\chapter{Ecclesiastes}

\section*{I of the month}

The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.

What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?

One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.

The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.

The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.

All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.

All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.

Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.

There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.

\section*{II of the month}

I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.

I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.

\section*{III of the month}

I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.

And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.

\section*{IV of the month}

I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.

I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?

I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.

I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:

I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:

I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:

I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:

\ding{43} I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, concubines very many.

So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.

Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.

\section*{V of the month}

And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.

Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.

The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.

Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.

For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.

Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

\section*{VI of the month}

\ding{43} I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.

Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.

For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.

For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?

For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.

\section*{VII of the month}

There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?

For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

\section*{VIII of the month}

To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:

A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;

A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;

A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;

A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;

A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;

A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;

\ding{43} A time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.

\section*{IX of the month}

What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?

I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.

\ding{43} He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.

And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.

I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.

\ding{43} That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God seeketh again that which is passed away.

\section*{X of the month}

And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.

I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.

I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.

For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.

All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.

\ding{43} Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?

Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

\section*{XI of the month}

So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.

Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.

Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

\section*{XII of the month}

Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.

\section*{XIII of the month}

Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.

\section*{XIV of the month}

Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.

For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.

Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?

And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

\section*{XV of the month}

Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.

For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.

I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.

There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

\section*{XVI of the month}

Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.

Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.

For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.

When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.

Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.

Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?

For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God.

\section*{XVII of the month}

If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.

Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.

He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.

When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?

The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.

There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.

As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.

And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?

All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.

Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.

Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.

For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.

\section*{XVIII of the month}

There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:

A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.

If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.

For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.

Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other.

Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?

\section*{XIX of the month}

All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.

For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?

Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

\ding{43} Whatsoever hath been, the name thereof was given long ago, and it is known what man is; neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.

Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?

For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?

\section*{XX of the month}

A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.

It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.

Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.

The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.

For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.

\ding{43} Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a bribe destroyeth the heart.

Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.

Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.

Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.

For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.

Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?

In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.

\section*{XXI of the month}

All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?

Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?

It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.

Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.

For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.

Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:

For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.

All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.

That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?

I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:

And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:

Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.

Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.

\section*{XXII of the month}

Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.

I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.

Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?

Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.

For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?

There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.

All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.

\section*{XXIII of the month}

And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.

Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.

Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:

But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.

There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.

Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.

When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)

Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.

\section*{XXIV of the month}

\ding{43} For all this I considered in my heart even to explore all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth whether it be love or hatred; all is before them.

All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.

This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.

For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.

For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.

\ding{43} Their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.

Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.

Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.

Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.

Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.

I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.

\section*{XXV of the month}

This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:

There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:

Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.

Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.

Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.

\section*{XXVI of the month}

Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.

A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.

Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.

If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:

Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.

He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

\ding{43} If the serpent bite before it is enchanted, then is there no advantage in the charmer.

The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.

The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.

Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!

Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!

By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.

A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.

Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.

\section*{XXVII of the month}

Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.

Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.

If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.

As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.

In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

\section*{XXVIII of the month}

Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:

But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.

Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.

Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.

\section*{XXIX of the month}

Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;

While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:

In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,

And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;

\ding{43} Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:

Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.

Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.

\section*{XXX of the month}

And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.

The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.

The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.

And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.

Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

\chapter{The Song of Solomon}

\section*{First-day (I, VIII, XV and XXII of the month)}

The song of songs, which is Solomon's.

Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.

Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: rightly do they\marginnote{\ding{43}} love thee.

I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.

Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.

I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.

Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.

We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.

A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.

My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.

Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.

Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.

The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.

\section*{Second-day (II, IX, XVI and XXII of the month)}

I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.

As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.

As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.

Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick from\marginnote{\ding{43}} love.

His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.

I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.

The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.

My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.

My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.

For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;

The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle dove\marginnote{\ding{43}} is heard in our land;

The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.

Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.

My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.

\section*{Third-day (III, X, XVII and XXIV of the month)}

By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.

I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.

Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?

Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.

They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.

Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

\section*{Fourth-day (IV, XI, XVIII and XXV of the month)}

Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.

Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.

Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.

Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.

Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.

Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.

How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!

Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.

A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.

Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,

Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:

A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.

Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

\section*{Fifth-day (V, XII, XIX and XXVI of the month)}

I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.

I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?

My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was\marginnote{\ding{43}} moved for him.

I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.

I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.

I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick from\marginnote{\ding{43}} love.

What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?

My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.

His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.

His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.

His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.

His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

\section*{Sixth-day (VI, XIII, XX and XXVII of the month)}

Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.

My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.

Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.

Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.

As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.

There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.

My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.

Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?

I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.

Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.

Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.

\section*{Seventh-day (VII, XIV, XXI and XXVIII of the month)}

How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.

Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.

Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.

Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.

How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!

This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.

I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy breath like apples;

And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.

I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.

Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.

Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.

The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.

\section*{Eighth-day (XXIX of the month)}

O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.

I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.

His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.

I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.

Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.

Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.

Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.

We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.

I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.

Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.

My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.

Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.

Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
